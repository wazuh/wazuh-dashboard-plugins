/*
 * PROCESS STATE CODES
 *    Here are the different values that the s, stat and state output specifiers (header "STAT" or "S") will display to describe the state of a
 *    process.
 *    D    Uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
 *    R    Running or runnable (on run queue)
 *    S    Interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
 *    T    Stopped, either by a job control signal or because it is being traced.
 *    W    paging (not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel)
 *    X    dead (should never be seen)
 *    Z    Defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by its parent.
 *
 *    For BSD formats and when the stat keyword is used, additional characters may be displayed:
 *    <    high-priority (not nice to other users)
 *    N    low-priority (nice to other users)
 *    L    has pages locked into memory (for real-time and custom IO)
 *    s    is a session leader
 *    l    is multi-threaded (using CLONE_THREAD, like NPTL pthreads do)
 *    +    is in the foreground process group
