# Usage

1.  Install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. For some Operating Systems it will fail and suggest a different way to install it (`sudo pacman -S python-xyz`, `sudo apt install python-xyz`, etc.).
    If the package is not found in this way, we can install it running `pip install -r requirements.txt --break-system-packages` (It is recommended to avoid this option if possible)

2.  Run the script with `python3 script.py`
3.  Follow the instructions that it will show on the console.
