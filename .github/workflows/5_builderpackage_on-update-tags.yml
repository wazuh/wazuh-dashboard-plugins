# 🚀 **Production Build Workflow**
#
# ⚡ **Overview:**
# This GitHub Action automatically builds a production-ready package whenever a new tag following the pattern `v*` is pushed.
#
# 🛠️ **Key Features:**
# - 🏷️ Triggered by tag creation (`v*`), ideal for versioned releases.
# - 📦 Produces a tagged artifact named `wazuh-<tag>`.
# - 🔄 Reuses the `5_builderprecompiled_base-dev-environment` workflow to maintain consistency across builds.
#
# ⚠️ **Notes:**
# - Ensure tag names follow the `v*` convention (e.g., `v1.2.3`).
