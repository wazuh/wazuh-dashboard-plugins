# CodeQL Workflow Configuration
#
# This workflow file will work for most projects without modifications; simply
# commit it to your repository.
#
# ## Optional Customization
# You may modify this file to:
# - Adjust the set of analyzed languages.
# - Add custom queries.
# - Include custom build logic.
#
# ## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note
# An attempt has been made to automatically detect the languages in your
# repository. Please review the `language` matrix defined below to ensure it
# includes the correct set of supported CodeQL languages.
#
# This workflow is used to perform code analysis with CodeQL:
#
# - üìÖ Weekly analysis of code for vulnerabilities.
# - üîê Applies static security analysis using CodeQL for JavaScript and
#   TypeScript.
