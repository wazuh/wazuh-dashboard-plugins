## Description
We need to ensure the UI compatibility with the next version of Elastic vX.X | OpenSearch vX.X.
This update is still being discussed, but we need to be aware of potential issues.

For that, we need to:

- [ ] Review opensearch and opensearch-dashboard latest stable changelog. 
- [ ] Identify improvements and potential impact on the UI.
- [ ] Develop a testing environment to verify our components would work under this new build.
