### Added
- New logging system ([#307](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-kibana-app/pull/307)):
  - New module implemented to write app logs.
  - Now a trace is stored every time the app is re/started.
  - Currently, the `initialize.js` and `monitoring.js` files works with this system.
  - Note: the logs will live under `/var/log/wazuh/wazuhapp.log` on Linux systems, on Windows systems they will live under `kibana/plugins/`. It rotates the log whenever it reaches 100MB.
- Better cookies handling ([#308](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-kibana-app/pull/308)):
  - New field on the `.wazuh-version` index to store the last time the Kibana server was restarted.
  - This is used to check if the cookies have consistency with the current sever status.
  - Now the app is clever and takes decissions depending on new consistency checks.
- New design for the *Agents/Configuration* tab ([#310](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-kibana-app/pull/310)):
  - The style is the same as the *Manager/Configuration* tab.
  - Added two more sections: CIS-CAT and Commands ([#315](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-kibana-app/pull/315)).
  - Added a new card that will appear when there's no group configuration at all ([#323](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-kibana-app/pull/323)).
- Added *"group"* column on the agents list in *Agents* ([#312](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-kibana-app/pull/312)):
  - If you click on the group, it will redirect the user to the specified group in *Manager/Groups*.
- New option for the `config.yml` file, `ip.selector` ([#313](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-kibana-app/pull/313)):
  - Define if the app will show or not the index pattern selector on the top navbar.
  - This setting is set to `true` by default.

  - New `typography.less` file.
  - New `layout.less` file.
  - Removed `cleaned.less` file.
  - Reordering and cleaning of existing CSS files, including removal of unused classes, renaming, and more.
  - The *Settings* tab has been refactored to correct some visual errors with some card components.
  - Small refactoring to some components from *Manager/Ruleset* ([#323](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-kibana-app/pull/323)).
- New design for the top navbar ([#326](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-kibana-app/pull/326)):

- Support for Elastic Stack v6.2.2/v6.2.3.

### Changed
- Improved the initialization system ([#317](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-kibana-app/pull/317)):
  - Now the app will re-create the index-pattern if the user deletes the currently used by the Wazuh app.
  - The fieldset is now automatically refreshed if the app detects mismatches.
  - Now every index-pattern is dynamically formatted (for example, to enable the URLs in the *Vulnerabilities* tab).
  - Several code refactoring for a better handling of possible use cases.
  - And the best thing, it's no longer needed to insert the sample alert!
- Improvements and changes to index-patterns ([#320](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-kibana-app/pull/320) & [#333](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-kibana-app/pull/333)):
  - New route, `/get-list`, to fetch the index pattern list.
  - Removed and changed several functions for a proper management of index-patterns.
  - Improved the compatibility with user-created index-patterns, known to have unpredictable IDs.
  - Now the app properly redirects to `/blank-screen` if the length of the index patterns list is 0.

    - Now it uses the value set on the `config.yml` file.
  - If the index pattern is no longer available, the cookie will be overwritten.
- Improvements to the monitoring module ([#322](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-kibana-app/pull/322)):
  - Minor refactoring to the whole module.
  - Now the `wazuh-monitoring` index pattern is regenerated if it's missing.
  - And the best thing, it's no longer needed to insert the monitoring template!
- Now the app healthcheck system only checks if the API and app have the same `major.minor` version ([#311](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-kibana-app/pull/311)):
  - Previously, the API and app had to be on the same `major.minor.patch` version.
- Adjusted space between title and value in some cards showing Manager or Agent configurations ([#315](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-kibana-app/pull/315)).
- Changed red and green colours to more saturated ones, following Kibana style ([#315](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-kibana-app/pull/315)).
