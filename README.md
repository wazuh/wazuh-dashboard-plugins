This repository contains the Wazuh Kibana plugin, from which you can navigate through the Wazuh data using visualizations in a simple and understandable way. It also allows you to manage the configuration and capabilities of the Wazuh server.

Wazuh is a security detection, visibility, and compliance open source project. Wazuh helps you to gain deeper security visibility into your infrastructure by monitoring hosts at an operating system and application level.

## Description

This plugin for Kibana allows you to visualize and analyze Wazuh alerts stored in Elasticsearch and provides the following capabilities:

- Search alerts classified by modules and filter them using the different views. You will be able to explore the alerts both at Wazuh cluster level, and in a particular agent. The modules, divided into the following use cases, are:
    - Security Information Management
        - Security events: Browse through your security alerts, identifying issues and threats in your environment.
        - Integrity monitoring: Alerts related to file changes, including permissions, content, ownership and attributes.
        - Amazon AWS: Security events related to your Amazon AWS services, collected directly via AWS API.
        - Office 365: Security events related to your Office 365 services.
        - GitHub: Security events related to your GitHub organizations, collected via GitHub audit logs API.
        - Google Cloud Platform: Security events related to your Google Cloud Platform services, collected directly via GCP API.
    - Auditing and Policy Monitoring
        - Policy monitoring: Verify that your systems are configured according to your security policies baseline.
        - Security configuration assessment: Scan your assets as part of a configuration assessment audit.
        - System auditing: Audit users behavior, monitoring command execution and alerting on access to critical files.
        - OpenSCAP: Configuration assessment and automation of compliance monitoring using SCAP checks.
        - CIS-CAT: Configuration assessment using Center of Internet Security scanner and SCAP checks.
    - Threat Detection and Response
        - Vulnerabilities: Discover what applications in your environment are affected by well-known vulnerabilities.
        - MITRE ATT&CK: Security events from the knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.
        - VirusTotal: Alerts resulting from VirusTotal analysis of suspicious files via an integration with their API.
        - Osquery: Osquery can be used to expose an operating system as a high-performance relational database.
        - Docker listener: Monitor and collect the activity from Docker containers such as creation, running, starting, stopping or pausing events.
    - Regulatory Compliance
        - PCI DSS: Global security standard for entities that process, store or transmit payment cardholder data.

systemctl stop kibana
```

- SysV Init:

```
service kibana stop
```
Ensure that the directory `/usr/share/kibana/data` exists
If not create it:

```
mkdir /usr/share/kibana/data
```

### From 3.11.x
Copy the `wazuh.yml` to its new location.

```
mkdir -p /usr/share/kibana/data/wazuh/config
cp /usr/share/kibana/plugins/wazuh/wazuh.yml /usr/share/kibana/optimize/wazuh/config/wazuh.yml
```
### From 4.0.4 - 4016
Copy the `wazuh.yml` to its new location.

```
mkdir -p /usr/share/kibana/data/wazuh/config
cp /usr/share/kibana/optimize/wazuh/config/wazuh.yml /usr/share/kibana/data/wazuh/config/wazuh.yml
```

```
mkdir -p /usr/share/kibana/data/wazuh/config
cp /usr/share/kibana/optimize/wazuh/config/wazuh.yml /usr/share/kibana/data/wazuh/config/wazuh.yml
```

Remove the Wazuh app using the kibana-plugin tool

```
cd /usr/share/kibana/
sudo -u kibana bin/kibana-plugin remove wazuh
```

Remove generated bundles

```
rm -rf /usr/share/kibana/optimize/bundles
```

Update file permissions. This will prevent errors when generating new bundles or updating the app:

```
chown -R kibana:kibana /usr/share/kibana/data
chown -R kibana:kibana /usr/share/kibana/plugins
```

Install the Wazuh app

```
cd /usr/share/kibana/
sudo -u kibana bin/kibana-plugin install https://packages.wazuh.com/4.x/ui/kibana/wazuh_kibana-4.3.10_7.10.2-1.zip
```

Update configuration file permissions.

```
sudo chown kibana:kibana /usr/share/kibana/data/wazuh/config/wazuh.yml
sudo chmod 600 /usr/share/kibana/data/wazuh/config/wazuh.yml
