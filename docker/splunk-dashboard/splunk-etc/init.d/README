WHERE ARE THE INIT SCRIPTS?
-----------------------------

The init scripts that used to reside in this directory are deprecated.  Splunk
now includes the ability to update the system boot configuration on its own.

For more info, see "splunk help boot-start".


QUICKSTART
------------

As root, you'll want to run "splunk enable boot-start".  This will create an
init script (or other configuration change) appropriate for your operating
system.

If you don't start Splunk as root, you can pass in the -user parameter to
specify which user to start Splunk as.  For example, if Splunk runs as the user
bob, then as root you would run "splunk enable boot-start -user bob".


PROBLEMS?
-----------

As usual, contact http://www.splunk.com/page/submit_issue if you have any issues.
