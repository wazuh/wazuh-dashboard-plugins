# This file contains potential attribute/value pairs to use when
# configuring Windows process monitoring. The procmon-filters.conf
# file is used in conjunction with sysmon.conf, and contains the
# specific regular expressions you create to refine and filter the
# processes you want Splunk to monitor.
