#   Version 9.0.3
#
# This file maintains the migration status in Splunk Enterprise.
#
# Splunk Enterprise automatically generates the configurations in
# this file during a migration.
# Do not edit any configurations in this file unless instructed to by
# Splunk support.
#
# There is no global, default migration.conf. When migrating between certain
# versions of Splunk Enterprise, Splunk will perform migration actions that
# must only be executed once. To ensure these actions are not performed during
# any subsequent migration, Splunk will create a migration.conf to record
# whether or not particular migration actions have taken place.
#
# To learn more about configuration files (including precedence) please see the
# documentation located at
