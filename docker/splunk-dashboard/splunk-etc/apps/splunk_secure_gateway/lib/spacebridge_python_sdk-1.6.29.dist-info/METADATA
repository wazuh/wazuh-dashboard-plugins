# Spacebridge App SK
SDK for integrating applications with Spacebridge (formerly called Cloud Gateway)


## Developer Setup
 - Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv venv`
 - Activate virtual environment `source venv/bin/activate` 
 - `make -B init` will install the necessary test dependencies python dependencies
 - `make -B build` will build the spacebridge sdk python package and install it as well as it's dependencies in the current virtual environment
 - `make -B test` will run unit tests
 
## IDE Setup
- In Pycharm go to `Preferences->Project:SpacebridgeAppSdk->Project Interpreter` and add your newly created virtual environment


## Usage 
If using the production version of the sdk, you can install it via splunk's artifactory: `pip install spacebridge_python_sdk`.
Splunk's artifactory needs to be already linked in your pip.conf which can be done via `make configure_pip`. 

If making changes to the sdk, build your own custom version of the package using `make package` which will create the python package under `dist`. 
Install this new package whereever you use the spacebridge sdk (your own virtual envioenment, splunk app, etc.)


### Examples
For end-to-end examples take a look at the examples folder. 

### Registration

The SDK offers the ability to either run from within a Splunk App or run as a standalone component. If you are running within a Splunk 
App, you can let the SDK handle the persistence of encryption information via Splunk's passwords API. To facilitate this, you need to create
a SplunkEncryptionContext object for which you need to provide a splunk system session token (this is because the passwords API requires a 
system level token to access it). This can be done as follows: 

```python
"""
This example requires a splunk session token. See the examples folder for an end-to-end example
"""
from cloudgateway.registration_api import authenticate_code, pair_device
from cloudgateway.auth.auth_credentials import SimpleUserCredentials
from cloudgateway.splunk.encryption import SplunkEncryptionContext
    
# Auth code shown on mobile device
AUTH_CODE = "WS5TREWAE8"

# Get mobile device's public keys 
encryption_context = SplunkEncryptionContext(session_key)
device_info = authenticate_code(AUTH_CODE, encryption_context)

# Use the splunk user's login credentials to finish pairing device, The mobile device will then authenticate 
# with splunk by using the supplied credentials
user_credentials = SimpleUserCredentials('admin', 'dishdash')
pair_device(AUTH_CODE, user_credentials, device_info, encryption_context)
```

Alternatively, you can use the SDK independently of Splunk. In this case,  you can instantiate a generic EncryptionContext object. The 
EncryptionContext object can take a EncryptionInfo object as a parameter which can be used to inject keys yourself. This will be useful 
if you want to use previously generated keys (i.e. if you do a system restart). Look at the examples section for a more involved example
on persisting encryption keys between sessions. 

```python
"""
This example is a stand alone example that should work without a splunk instance. 
"""
from cloudgateway.registration_api import authenticate_code, pair_device
from cloudgateway.auth.auth_credentials import SimpleUserCredentials
from cloudgateway.encryption import SplunkEncryptionContext
    
# Auth code shown on mobile device
AUTH_CODE = "WS5TREWAE8"

# Get mobile device's public keys 
encryption_context = EncryptionContext()
def resolve_app_name(app_id):
    # if you need a human friendly app name, do the mapping here
    return None
device_info = authenticate_code(AUTH_CODE, encryption_context, resolve_app_name)

# Use the splunk user's login credentials to finish pairing device, The mobile device will then authenticate 
# with splunk by using the supplied credentials
user_credentials = SimpleUserCredentials('admin', 'dishdash')
pair_device(AUTH_CODE, user_credentials, device_info, encryption_context)
```

### Connecting to Spacebridge/Cloud Gateway
The below example demonstrates how to instantiate a websocket client to Cloud Gateway. It
relies on a Splunk instance to manage the keys. If running as a standalone app, simply change the encryption context object
to the base EncryptionContext object (like the above example).

In order to initiate a websocket connection to spacebridge, we first have to implement the AbstractMessageHandler interface. We have to implement the `handle_application_message`, `handle_cloudgateway_message` methods which specifies how we want to handle messages coming from the client/server side as well as how to handle messages coming in from Spacebridge itself. 

```python

from cloudgateway.private.util.dev import set_splunk_env
set_splunk_env()
import base64

import splunk.rest as rest
from cloudgateway.websocket import CloudGatewayWsClient, AbstractMessageHandler
from protocol.splapp_protocol import envelope_pb2

device_info_map = {}

class SimpleMessageHandler(AbstractMessageHandler):

    def handle_application_message(self, msg, sender, rid):
        client_application_message = envelope_pb2.ClientApplicationMessage()
        client_application_message.ParseFromString(msg)
        print client_application_message

    def handle_cloudgateway_message(self, msg):
        print msg

    def fetch_device_info(self, device_id):
        return device_info_map[base64.b64encode(device_id)]


class DummyLogger(object):
    def info(self, msg):
        print msg

    def debug(self, msg):
        print msg

if __name__ == "__main__":
    encryption_context = SplunkEncryptionContext(session_key)
    client = CloudGatewayWsClient(encryption_context, SimpleMessageHandler(session_key), logger=DummyLogger())
    client.connect()

```
