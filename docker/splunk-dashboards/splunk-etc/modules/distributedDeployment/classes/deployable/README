This bundle enables metrics information to be routed from all DeploymentClient(s) (i.e. 'deployable' Splunks) to the DeploymentServer.

outputs.conf
------------
This configuration will establish a tcpout route by the name of 'RouteMetricsToDeploymentServer'. Make sure you change the server_name:port information. Any event with a _TCP_ROUTING field will be forwarder to the specified server. Our intention is to add this field to all events in metrics.log - see inputs.conf below.

[tcpout:RouteMetricsToDeploymentServer]
server=YourDeploymentServerHostname:9997


inputs.conf
-----------
The following configuration will cause all metrics.log events to be routed to a tcpout group named 'RouteMetricsToDeploymentServer'. See outputs.conf above on how that happens.

[monitor://$SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/metrics.log]
_TCP_ROUTING = RouteMetricsToDeploymentServer
