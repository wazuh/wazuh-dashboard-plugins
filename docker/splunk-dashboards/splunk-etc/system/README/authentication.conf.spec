#   Version 9.0.3
#
# This file contains possible settings and values for configuring
# authentication via authentication.conf.
#
# There is an authentication.conf file in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/default/. To
# set custom configurations, place an authentication.conf in
# $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/. For examples, see
# authentication.conf.example. You must restart the Splunk platform to enable
# configurations.
#
# To learn more about configuration files, including precedence, see
# http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Aboutconfigurationfiles.

# GLOBAL SETTINGS
# Use the [default] stanza to define any global settings.
#   * You can also define global settings outside of any stanza, at the top
#     of the file.
#   * Each .conf file should have at most one default stanza. If there are
#     multiple default stanzas, settings are combined. In the case of
#     multiple definitions of the same setting, the last definition in the
#     file wins.
#   * If a setting is defined at both the global level and in a specific
#     stanza, the value in the specific stanza takes precedence.

[authentication]
* Follow this stanza name with any number of the following setting/value
  pairs.

authType = [Splunk|LDAP|Scripted|SAML|ProxySSO]
* Specify which authentication system to use.
* Supported values: Splunk, LDAP, Scripted, SAML, ProxySSO.
* Default: Splunk

authSettings = <authSettings-key>,<authSettings-key>,...
* Key to look up the specific configurations of chosen authentication
  system.
* <authSettings-key> is the name of a stanza header that specifies
  settings for scripted authentication, SAML, ProxySSO and for an LDAP
  strategy. Those stanzas are defined below.
* For LDAP, specify the LDAP strategy name(s) here. If you want Splunk
  software to query multiple LDAP servers, provide a comma-separated list
  of all strategies. Each strategy must be defined in its own stanza.
  The order in which you specify the strategy names is the order Splunk
  software uses to query their servers when looking for a user.
* For scripted authentication, <authSettings-key> should be a single
  stanza name.

passwordHashAlgorithm = [SHA512-crypt|SHA256-crypt|SHA512-crypt-<num_rounds>|SHA256-crypt-<num_rounds>|MD5-crypt]
* This controls how hashed passwords are stored in the
  $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/passwd file for the default "Splunk" authType.
* "MD5-crypt" is an algorithm originally developed for FreeBSD in the early
  1990s, which became a widely used standard among UNIX machines. Splunk
  Enterprise also used it through the 5.0.x releases. MD5-crypt runs the
  salted password through a sequence of 1000 MD5 operations.
* "SHA256-crypt" and "SHA512-crypt" are newer versions that use 5000 rounds
  of the Secure Hash Algorithm-256 (SHA256) or SHA512 hash functions.
  This is slower than MD5-crypt and therefore more resistant to dictionary
  attacks.  SHA512-crypt is used for system passwords on many versions of Linux.
* These SHA-based algorithm can optionally be followed by a number of rounds
  to use. For example, "SHA512-crypt-10000" uses twice as many rounds
  of hashing as the default implementation. The number of rounds must be at
  least 1000.
  If you specify a very large number of rounds (i.e. more than 20x the
  default value of 5000), splunkd might become unresponsive and connections to
  splunkd (from Splunk Web or CLI) time out.
* This setting only affects new password settings (either when a user is
  added or a user's password is changed).  Existing passwords work but retain their
  previous hashing algorithm.
* Default: SHA512-crypt

defaultRoleIfMissing = <splunk role>
* Applicable for LDAP authType. If the LDAP server does not return any groups, or if
  groups cannot be mapped to Splunk roles, then this value is used, if provided.
* This setting is optional.
* Default: empty string

externalTwoFactorAuthVendor = <string>
* A valid multifactor vendor string enables multifactor authentication
  and loads support for the corresponding vendor if supported by the the Splunk platform.
* An empty string disables multifactor authentication in the the Splunk platform.
* Currently Splunk supports Duo and RSA as multifactor authentication vendors.
* This setting is optional.
* No default.

externalTwoFactorAuthSettings = <externalTwoFactorAuthSettings-key>
* Key to look up the specific configuration of chosen multifactor
  authentication vendor.
* This setting is optional.
* No default.

# LDAP settings
#####################

[<authSettings-key>]
* Follow this stanza name with the following setting/value pairs.
* For multiple strategies, specify multiple instances of
  this stanza, each with its own stanza name and a separate set of
  settings.
* The <authSettings-key> must be one of the values listed in the
  authSettings setting, which must be specified in the previous [authentication]
  stanza.

host = <string>
* The hostname of the LDAP server.
* Confirm that your Splunk server can resolve the host name through DNS.
* Required.
* No default.

SSLEnabled = [0|1]
* Specifies whether SSL is enabled.
* See the file $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/openldap/ldap.conf for SSL LDAP settings
* This setting is optional.
* Default: 0 (disabled)

port = <integer>
* The port that the Splunk platform should use to connect to your LDAP server.
* This setting is optional.
* Default (non-SSL): 389
* Default (SSL): 636

bindDN = <string>
* The LDAP Distinguished Name of the user that retrieves the LDAP entries.
* This user must have read access to all LDAP users and groups you wish to
  use in the auth system.
* This setting is optional.
* Leave this setting blank to retrieve your LDAP entries using
  anonymous bind (which must be supported by the LDAP server)
* No default.

bindDNpassword = <password>
* Password for the bindDN user.
* This setting is optional.
* Leave this blank if anonymous bind is sufficient.
* No default.

userBaseDN = <string>
* The distinguished names of LDAP entries whose subtrees contain the users.
* Enter a ';' delimited list to search multiple trees.
* Required.
* No default.

userBaseFilter = <string>
* The LDAP search filter to use when searching for users.
* Highly recommended, especially when there are many entries in your LDAP
  user subtrees.
* When used properly, search filters can significantly speed up LDAP queries
* Here is an example that matches users in the IT or HR department:
    * userBaseFilter = (|(department=IT)(department=HR))
    * See RFC 2254 for more detailed information on search filter syntax
* This setting is optional.
* Default: empty string (no filtering)

userNameAttribute = <string>
* This is the username.
* NOTE: This setting should use case insensitive matching for its values,
  and the values should not contain whitespace
    * Usernames are case insensitive in the the Splunk platform
* In Active Directory, this is 'sAMAccountName'
* Required.
* A typical value is 'uid'.
* No default.

realNameAttribute = <string>
* The user's real, human readable name.
* Required.
* A typical value is 'cn'.
* No default.

emailAttribute = <string>
* The user's email address.
* This setting is optional.
* Default: mail

groupMappingAttribute = <string>
* The value that group entries use to declare membership.
* Groups are often mapped with user DN, so this defaults to 'dn'
* Set this if groups are mapped using a different setting
  * Usually only needed for OpenLDAP servers.
  * A typical setting is 'uid'
    * For example, assume a group declares that one of its members is
      'splunkuser' â€” every user with the 'uid' value 'splunkuser' is
      mapped to that group.
* This setting is optional.
* No default.

groupBaseDN = [<string>;<string>;...]
* The LDAP Distinguished Names of LDAP entries whose subtrees contain
  the groups.
* Required.
* Enter a semicolon (;) delimited list to search multiple trees.
* If your LDAP environment does not have group entries, there is a
  configuration that can treat each user as its own group:
  * Set groupBaseDN to the same as userBaseDN, which means you search
    for groups in the same place as users.
  * Next, set the groupMemberAttribute and groupMappingAttribute to the same
    setting as userNameAttribute.
    * This means the entry, when treated as a group, uses the username
      value as its only member.
  * For clarity, also set groupNameAttribute to the same
    value as userNameAttribute.
* No default.

groupBaseFilter = <string>
* The LDAP search filter the Splunk platform uses when searching for static groups
* Like 'userBaseFilter', this is highly recommended to speed up LDAP queries
* See Request for Comments (RFC) 2254 on the Internet Engineering Task Force
  (IETF) website for more information.
* This setting is optional.
* Default: empty string (no filtering).

dynamicGroupFilter = <string>
* The LDAP search filter the Splunk platform uses when searching for dynamic groups.
* Configure this setting only if you intend to retrieve dynamic groups
  on your LDAP server.
* Example: '(objectclass=groupOfURLs)'
* This setting is optional.
* Default: empty string

dynamicMemberAttribute = <string>
* This setting contains the LDAP URL needed to retrieve members dynamically.
* Only configure this if you intend to retrieve dynamic groups on your
  LDAP server.
* This setting is required if you want to retrieve dynamic groups.
* Otherwise, it is optional.
* Example: 'memberURL'
* No default.

groupNameAttribute = <string>
* This is the group entry setting whose value stores the group name.
* A typical setting for this is 'cn' (common name)
* Recall that if you are configuring LDAP to treat user entries as their own
  group, user entries must have this setting
* Required.
* Default: empty string

groupMemberAttribute = <string>
* This is the group entry setting whose values are the groups members
* Typical setting for this are 'member' and 'memberUid'
* For example, consider the groupMappingAttribute example above using
  groupMemberAttribute 'member'
  * To declare 'splunkuser' as a group member, its setting 'member' must
    have the value 'splunkuser'
* Required.
* Default: empty string

nestedGroups = <boolean>
* Controls whether the Splunk platform expands nested groups using the
  'memberof' extension.
* Set to 1 if you have nested groups you want to expand and the 'memberof'
  extension on your LDAP server.
* This setting is optional.

charset = <string>
* Only set this for an LDAP setup that returns non-UTF-8 encoded data. LDAP
  is supposed to always return UTF-8 encoded data (See RFC 2251), but some
  tools incorrectly return other encodings.
* Follows the same format as 'CHARSET' in props.conf (see props.conf.spec)
* An example value would be "latin-1"
* This setting is optional.
* Default: empty string

anonymous_referrals = [0|1]
* Set this to 0 to turn off referral chasing
* Set this to 1 to turn on anonymous referral chasing
* NOTE: the Splunk platform only chases referrals using anonymous bind.
        It does not support rebinding using credentials.
* If you do not need referral support, set this to 0.
* If you wish to make referrals work, set this to 1 and confirm your server
  allows anonymous searching
* This setting is optional.
* Default: 1

sizelimit = <integer>
* Limits the amount of entries that the Splunk platform requests in LDAP search.
* NOTE: The max entries returned is still subject to the maximum
        imposed by your LDAP server.
  * Example: If you set this to 5000 and the server limits it to 1000,
             the software only returns 1000 entries.
* This setting is optional.
* Default: 1000

pagelimit = <integer>
* The maximum number of entries to return in each page.
* Enables result sets that exceed the maximum number of entries defined for the
  LDAP server.
* If set to -1, ldap pagination is off.
* IMPORTANT: The maximum number of entries a page returns is subject to
  the maximum page size limit of the LDAP server. For example: If you set 'pagelimit =
  5000' and the server limit is 1000, you cannot receive more than 1000 entries in
  a page.
* This setting is optional.
* Default: -1

enableRangeRetrieval = <boolean>
* The maximum number of values that can be retrieved from one attribute in a
  single LDAP search request is determined by the LDAP server. If the number of
  users in a group exceeds the LDAP server limit, enabling this setting fetches all
  users by using the "range retrieval" mechanism.
* Enables result sets for a given attribute that exceed the maximum number of
  values defined for the LDAP server.
* If set to false, ldap range retrieval is off.
* This setting is optional.
* Default: false

timelimit = <integer>
* Limits the amount of time, in seconds, that the Splunk platform waits for an LDAP search
  request to complete.
* If your searches finish quickly, lower this value from the default.
* Maximum value is 30 seconds
* Default: 15

network_timeout = <integer>
* Limits the amount of time a socket polls a connection without activity
* This is useful for determining if your LDAP server cannot be reached
* NOTE: As a connection could be waiting for search results, this value
        must be higher than 'timelimit'.
* Like 'timelimit', if you have a fast connection to your LDAP server,
  lower this value.
* Maximum value is -1 (unlimited)
* This setting is optional.
* Default: 20

ldap_negative_cache_timeout = <nonnegative decimal>
* The amount of time, in seconds, that the Splunk platform remembers that a non-existent
  user on an LDAP provider does not exist.
* This setting is useful when you want to avoid frequent LDAP queries for users
  that do not exist on the LDAP provider.
* This setting does not prevent LDAP queries on login. Login always queries the LDAP
  provider to confirm that a user exists.
* Default: 86400

#####################
# Map roles
#####################

[roleMap_<authSettings-key>]
* The mapping of Splunk roles to LDAP groups for the LDAP strategy specified
  by <authSettings-key>
* Follow this stanza name with several Role-to-Group(s) mappings as defined
  below.
* NOTE: This role mapping ONLY applies to the specified strategy.
* Importing groups for the same user from different strategies is not
  supported.

<Splunk RoleName> = <semicolon-separated list>
* Maps a Splunk role from the authorize.conf configuration file to one or more LDAP groups.
* Separate multiple LDAP groups with semicolons, not spaces.
* List several of these setting/value pairs to map several Splunk roles to
  LDAP Groups.
* LDAP group names are case sensitive.

#####################
# Scripted authentication
#####################

[<authSettings-key>]
* Follow this stanza name with the following setting/value pairs:

python.version = {default|python|python2|python3}
* For Python scripts only, selects which Python version to use.
* Set to either "default" or "python" to use the system-wide default Python
  version.
* Optional.
* Default: Not set; uses the system-wide Python version.

scriptSearchFilters = [1|0]
* Whether or not to call the script to add search filters.
* Set this to 1 to call the script to add search filters.
* Default: 0

[cacheTiming]
* Use these settings to adjust how long the Splunk platform uses the answers returned
  from script functions before calling them again.
* All timeouts can be expressed in seconds or as a search-like time range
* Examples include "30" (30 seconds), "2mins" (2 minutes), "24h" (24 hours), etc.
* You can opt to use no caching for a particular function by setting the
  value to "0".
  * Be aware that this can severely hinder performance as a result of heavy
    script invocation.
* Choosing the correct values for cache timing involves a tradeoff between
  new information latency and general performance.
  * High values yield better performance from calling the script less, but
    introduces a latency in picking up changes.
  * Low values pick up changes in your external auth system more
    quickly, but can slow down performance due to increased script
    invocations.

userLoginTTL = <time range string>
* The timeout for the 'userLogin' script function.
* These return values are cached on a per-user basis.
* Default: 0 (no caching)

userInfoTTL = <time range string>
* How long the auth system caches information that it retrieves with the
  'getUserInfo' and 'getUsers' scripts.
* These return values are cached on a per-user basis.
* Default (if you have configured either 'getUserInfoTTL' or 'getUsersTTL'): the larger value of these settings
* Default (otherwise): 10s

getUserInfoTTL = <time range string>
* DEPRECATED; use 'userInfoTTL' instead.
* How long the auth system caches information that it retrieves with the
  'getUserInfo' script.
* These return values are cached on a per-user basis.
* Default: 10s

getUsersTTL = <time range string>
* DEPRECATED; use 'userInfoTTL' instead.
* The timeout for the getUsers script function.
* There is only one global getUsers cache (it is not tied to a
  specific user).
* Default: 10s

* This setting is optional.
* the Splunk platform uses this information to populate the 'assertionConsumerServiceUrl'.
* Default: empty string

redirectPort = <port number>
* The port where SAML responses are sent.
* Typically, this is the web port.
* If internal port redirection is needed, set this port and the
  'assertionconsumerServiceUrl' in the AuthNRequest contains this port
  instead of the Splunk Web port.
* To prevent any port information to be appended in the
  'assertionConsumerServiceUrl' setting, set this to 0.
* No default.

idpSSOUrl = <url>
* The protocol endpoint on the IDP (Identity Provider) where the
  AuthNRequests should be sent.
* Required.
* SAML requests fail if this information is missing.
* No default.

idpAttributeQueryUrl = <url>
* The protocol endpoint on the IDP (Identity Provider) where the setting
  query requests should be sent.
* Attribute queries can be used to get the latest 'role' information,
  if there is support for Attribute queries on the IDP.
* This setting is optional.
* When this setting is absent, the Splunk platform caches the role information
  from the SAML assertion and use it to run saved searches.
* No default.

idpCertPath = <string>
* This value is relative to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/auth/idpCerts.
* The value for this setting can be the name of the certificate file or a directory.
* If it is empty, the Splunk platform automatically verify with certificates in all
  subdirectories present in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/auth/idpCerts.
* If the SAML response is to be verified with a IdP (Identity Provider) certificate that
  is self signed, then this setting holds the filename of the certificate.
* If the SAML response is to be verified with a certificate that is a part of a
  certificate chain(root, intermediate(s), leaf), create a subdirectory and place the
  certificate chain as files in the subdirectory.
* If there are multiple end certificates, create a subdirectory such that, one
  subdirectory holds one certificate chain.
* If multiple such certificate chains are present, the assertion is considered verified,
  if validation succeeds with any certificate chain.
* The file names within a certificate chain should be such that root certificate
  is alphabetically before the intermediate which is alphabetically before of
  the end cert.
  ex. cert_1.pem has the root, cert_2.pem has the first intermediate cert,
      cert_3.pem has the second intermediate certificate and cert_4.pem has the
      end certificate.
* This setting is required if 'signedAssertion' is set to true.

* The URL to be displayed for a SAML error.
* Errors may be due to erroneous or incomplete configuration in either
  the IDP or the Splunk platform.
* This URL can be absolute or relative.
  * Absolute URLs should follow the pattern
    <protocol>:[//]<host> e.g. https://www.external-site.com.
  * Relative URLs should start with '/'. A relative url shows up as an
    internal link of the Splunk instance, for
    example: https://splunkhost:port/relativeUrlWithSlash
* No default.

errorUrlLabel = <string>
* Label or title of the content pointed to by errorUrl.
* This setting is optional.
* No default.

entityId = <string>
* The entity ID for SP connection as configured on the IDP.
* Required.
* No default.

issuerId = <string>
* Required.
* The unique identifier of the identity provider.
  The value of this setting corresponds to the setting "entityID" of
  "EntityDescriptor" node in IdP metadata document.
* If you configure SAML using IdP metadata, this field is extracted from
  the metadata.
* If you configure SAML manually, then you must configure this setting.
* When the Splunk platform tries to verify the SAML response, the issuerId
  specified here must match the 'Issuer' field in the SAML response. Otherwise,
  validation of the SAML response fails.

signAuthnRequest = <boolean>
* Whether or not the Splunk platform should sign AuthNRequests.
* This setting is optional.
* Default: true

signedAssertion = <boolean>
* Whether or not the SAML assertion has been signed by the IDP.

* Whether or not authentication uses the OpenSSL X509_V_FLAG_PARTIAL_CHAIN
* flag when performing validation on a SAML certificate chain.
* Configuring this setting to "true" lets verification of SAML certificates
* succeed even in cases where a complete certificate chain cannot be built
* back to a self-signed trust anchor certificate.
* When set to "true", intermediate certificates in the trust store are
* treated as trust-anchors in the same way as self-signed root certificate
* authority certificates.
* Uses X509_V_FLAG_PARTIAL_CHAIN flag during certificate verification.
* This setting is optional.
* Default: false

redirectAfterLogoutToUrl = <string>

* No default.

skipAttributeQueryRequestForUsers = <comma-separated list of users>
* To skip attribute query requests being sent to the IdP for certain users,
  add them with this setting.
* By default, attribute query requests are skipped for local users.
* If you configure this setting for non-local users, you must also configure 'defaultRoleIfMissing'.
* No default.

maxAttributeQueryThreads = <integer>
* Number of threads to use to make attribute query requests.

* Optional
* Default: 10s

scriptFunctions = <semicolon-separated list>
* Script functions to be enabled for authentication extensions.
* Expressed as a list.
* Supported values are 'getUsers', 'getUserInfo', and 'login'.
* To use the 'getUsers' function, you must also enable the 'getUserInfo' function.
* You must set this if you define 'scriptPath'.
* No default.

getUsersPrecacheLimit = <integer>
* The number of users to pre-cache on startup for the 'getUsers' script function.
* If you enable the 'getUsers' function, the script executes when splunkd starts up.
* As part of startup, splunkd caches user information that the 'getUsers' script returns,
  and this setting specifies how many users to cache.
* If you set 'getUsersPrecacheLimit' to 0, splunkd caches all user information that
  the 'getUsers' function returns.
* Default: 1000

getUserInfoTtl = <string>
* When you configure the auth system to use SAML as an authentication method,
  it runs the 'getUserInfo' script function to retrieve information from the
  SAML identity provider when users perform ad-hoc operations such as working
  with tokens and saved searches.
* This setting controls how long the auth system caches information that it
  retrieves with the 'getUserInfo' script function.
* This setting does not control how the method retrieves user information
  when one logs in using the standard SAML login flow through a browser.
* These return values are cached on a per-user basis.
* This value also applies if users are retrieved en masse using the scripts
  getUsers() function.
* If you configure both AQR and authentication extensions (meaning, you configure
  both 'attributeQueryTTL' and 'getUserInfoTTL', this setting takes precedence.
* This setting is optional.
* Default: 10s

scriptSecureArguments = <key:value>;[<key:value>;]...
* A list of inputs, expressed as key-value pairs, that will be made available
  in plaintext to the custom user information retrieval script.
* On startup, the auth system encrypts the values you specify here.

  are available as normal arguments for all functions.
* This setting is optional.
* No default.

useAuthExtForTokenAuthOnly = <boolean>
* Whether authentication extension scripts run for all types of authentication, 
  or only for token based authentication.
* If set to "true", the 'getUserInfo' script only runs when making token based authentication calls.
* Other calls that rely on fetching SAML user information, 
  such as saved searches and displaying SAML users,
  will use the persistent cache that is defined in the [userToRoleMap_<saml-authSettings-key>] stanza.
* This setting is optional.
* Default: true

assertionTimeSkew = <integer>
* The amount of clock skew, in seconds, that can occur between the Splunk platform and
  an identity provider that presents SAML assertions that contain 'NotBefore'
  and 'NotOnOrAfter' attributes.
* If you set this, the Splunk platform accepts a SAML assertion as valid if
  the clock skew between the assertion validity interval and the system time on the
  Splunk instance is not greater than the value of this setting.
* NOTE: Setting this to too high a value can allow for replay attacks and is a security risk.
* This setting is optional.
* Default: 120

allowSslCompression = <boolean>
* If set to true, the server allows clients to negotiate SSL-layer
  data compression.
* This setting is optional.
* Default: The value of 'allowSslCompression' in the server.conf file

cipherSuite = <cipher suite string>
* If set, the Splunk platform uses the specified cipher string for the HTTP server.
* Attribute query requests might fail if the IDP requires a relaxed
  ciphersuite.
* Use "openssl s_client -cipher 'TLSv1+HIGH:@STRENGTH' -host <IDP host> -port 443"
  to determine if the Splunk platform can connect to the IDP.
* This setting is optional.
* Default: The value or 'cipherSuite' in the server.conf file

sslVersions = <versions_list>
* Comma-separated list of SSL versions to support.

* Default: The value of 'sslVersions' in the server.conf file

sslCommonNameToCheck = <commonName>
* If set, and 'sslVerifyServerCert' is set to true,
  splunkd limits most outbound HTTPS connections to hosts which use
  a cert with this common name.
* This setting is optional.
* Default: The value of 'cipherSuite' in the server.conf file

sslAltNameToCheck = <alternateName1>, <alternateName2>, ...
* If this value is set, and 'sslVerifyServerCert' is set to true,
  splunkd is also willing to verify certificates which have a so-called
  "Subject Alternate Name" that matches any of the alternate names in this list.
* This setting is optional.
* Default: The value of 'sslAltNametoCheck' in the server.conf file

ecdhCurveName = <string>
* DEPRECATED; use 'ecdhCurves' instead.
* Elliptic Curve-Diffie Hellman (ECDH) curve to use for ECDH key negotiation.
* Default: The value of 'ecdhCurveName' in the server.conf file

ecdhCurves = <comma separated list>
* ECDH curves to use for ECDH key negotiation.
* The curves should be specified in the order of preference.
* The client sends these curves as a part of Client Hello.
* The server supports only the curves specified in the list.
* The Splunk platform only supports named curves that have been
  specified by their SHORT names.
* The list of valid named curves by their short/long names can be obtained
  by executing this CLI command:
  $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk cmd openssl ecparam -list_curves
* Example setting: ecdhCurves = prime256v1,secp384r1,secp521r1
* Default: The value of 'ecdhCurves' in the server.conf file

clientCert = <path>
* Full path to the client certificate Privacy-Enhanced Mail (PEM) format file.
* Certificates are auto-generated upon first starting the Splunk platform.
* You may replace the auto-generated certificate with your own.
* If not set, Splunk uses the setting specified in
  server.conf/[sslConfig]/'serverCert'.
* Default: $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/auth/server.pem

sslKeysfile = <filename>
* DEPRECATED; use 'clientCert' instead.
* Location of the PEM file in the directory specified by 'caPath'.
* Default: server.pem

sslPassword = <password>
* The server certificate password.
* If not set, the Splunk platform uses the setting specified in server.conf.
* This setting is optional.
* Default: password

sslKeysfilePassword = <password>
* DEPRECATED; use 'sslPassword' instead.

caCertFile = <filename>
* The public key of the signing authority.
* If not set, the Splunk platform uses the setting specified in server.conf.
* This setting is optional.
* Default: cacert.pem

caPath = <path>
* DEPRECATED; use absolute paths for all certificate files.
* If certificate files given by other settings in this stanza are not absolute
  paths, then they are relative to this path.
* Default: $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/auth

sslVerifyServerCert = <boolean>
* Used by distributed search: when making a search request to another
  server in the search cluster.
* If not set, the Splunk platform uses the setting specified in server.conf.
* This setting is optional.
* No default.

sslVerifyServerName = <boolean>
* Whether or not splunkd, as a client, performs a TLS hostname validation check
  on an SSL certificate that it receives upon an initial connection
  to a server.
* A TLS hostname validation check ensures that a client
  communicates with the correct server, and has not been redirected to
  another by a machine-in-the-middle attack, where a malicious party inserts
  themselves between the client and the target server, and impersonates
  that server during the session.
* Specifically, the validation check forces splunkd to verify that either
  the Common Name or the Subject Alternate Name in the certificate that the
  server presents to the client matches the host name portion of the URL that
  the client used to connect to the server.
* For this setting to have any effect, the 'sslVerifyServerCert' setting must
  have a value of "true". If it doesn't, TLS hostname validation is not possible
  because certificate verification is not on.
* A value of "true" for this setting means that splunkd performs a TLS hostname
  validation check, in effect, verifying the server's name in the certificate.
  If that check fails, splunkd terminates the SSL handshake immediately. This terminates
  the connection between the client and the server. Splunkd logs this failure at
  the ERROR logging level.
* A value of "false" means that splunkd does not perform the TLS hostname
  validation check. If the server presents an otherwise valid certificate, the
  client-to-server connection proceeds normally.
* Default: false

blacklistedAutoMappedRoles = <comma separated list>
* DEPRECATED; use 'excludedAutoMappedRoles' instead.

excludedAutoMappedRoles = <comma separated list>
* Comma separated list of splunk roles that should be prevented
  from being auto-mapped by splunk from the IDP Response.
* This setting is optional.
* No default.

blacklistedUsers = <comma separated list>
* DEPRECATED; use 'excludedUsers' instead.

excludedUsers = <comma separated list>
* Comma separated list of user names from the IDP response to be
  excluded by splunk platform.
* This setting is optional.
* No default.

nameIdFormat = <string>
* If supported by IDP, while making SAML Authentication request this value can
  be used to specify the format of the Subject returned in SAML Assertion.
* This setting is optional.
* No default.

ssoBinding = <string>
* The binding that is used when making a SP-initiated SAML request.
* Acceptable options are "HTTPPost" and "HTTPRedirect".
* This binding must match the one configured on the IDP.
* This setting is optional.
* Default: HTTPPost

sloBinding = <string>
* The binding that is used when making a logout request or sending a logout
  response to complete the logout workflow.
* Acceptable options are "HTTPPost" and "HTTPRedirect".
* This binding must match the one configured on the IDP.
* This setting is optional.
* Default: HTTPPost

signatureAlgorithm = RSA-SHA1 | RSA-SHA256 | RSA-SHA384 | RSA-SHA512
* The signature algorithm that is used for outbound SAML messages,
  for example, SP-initiated SAML request.
* This setting is only used when 'signAuthnRequest' is set to "true".
* This setting is applicable for both HTTP POST and HTTP Redirect binding.
* RSA-SHA1 corresponds to 'http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#rsa-sha1'.
* RSA-SHA256, RSA-SHA384, and RSA-SHA512 correspond to 'http://www.w3.org/2001/04/xmldsig-more'.
* This algorithm is sent as a part of 'sigAlg'.
* For improved security, set to "RSA-SHA256", "RSA-SHA384", or "RSA-SHA512".
* This setting is optional.
* Default: RSA-SHA1

inboundSignatureAlgorithm = RSA-SHA1;RSA-SHA256;RSA-SHA384;RSA-SHA512
* A semicolon-separated list of signature algorithms for the SAML responses
  that you want Splunk Web to accept.
* The Splunk platform rejects any SAML responses that are not signed by
  any one of the specified algorithms.
* This setting is applicable for both HTTP POST and HTTP Redirect binding.
* For improved security, set to "RSA-SHA256", "RSA-SHA384", or "RSA-SHA512".
* This setting is optional.
* Default: RSA-SHA1;RSA-SHA256;RSA-SHA384;RSA-SHA512

inboundDigestMethod = SHA1;SHA256;SHA384;SHA512
* A semicolon-separated list of digest methods for the SAML responses
  that you want Splunk Web to accept.
* The Splunk platform rejects any SAML responses that are not hashed by
  any one of the specified methods.
* This setting is applicable for HTTP POST binding only.
* For improved security, set to "SHA256", "SHA384", or "SHA512".
* This setting is optional.
* Default: SHA1;SHA256;SHA384;SHA512

replicateCertificates = <boolean>
* If set to "true", IdP certificate files are replicated across search head cluster setup.
* If disabled, IdP certificate files need to be replicated manually across SHC,
  otherwise verification of SAML-signed assertions fails.
* This setting has no effect if search head clustering is disabled.
* This setting is optional.
* Default: true

lockRoleToFullDN = <boolean>
* Determines how the auth system handles authentication when it receives a
  Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) assertion from an identity
  provider (IdP) in specific cases.
* This setting applies only under the following conditions:
  * You have configured a Common Name (CN) mapping to a Splunk role
    under a [roleMap_SAML] stanza in authentication.conf. The auth system
    ignores this setting if you have configured a full Distinguished Name (DN)
    role mapping.
  * The IdP returns a full DN as part of the SAML assertion. The auth system
    ignores this setting if the IdP does not return a full DN in the assertion.
* If set to "false", the auth system uses the first part of the DN that the IdP
  provides in the assertion, and ignores the rest of the DN.
* If set to "true", the auth system does the following:
  * If you have configured a role mapping under the [roleMap_SAML] stanza that
    contains the full DN, the auth system uses the DN and logs the user in.
  * If you have configured a role mapping under the [roleMap_SAML] stanza that
    contains the CN, but not the full DN, the auth system successfully logs in
    the first user whose CN matches the role mapping, and records the full
    DN into a [lockedRoleToFullDNMap_SAML] stanza in authentication.conf.
  * The auth system then rejects subsequent authentication attempts by users
    that have a matching CN but do not have a full DN. It logs such rejections
    in splunkd.log.
  * To stop authentication failures in this case, as a Splunk admin, you must
    add the DN to the [roleMap_SAML] stanza in authentication.conf. Editing the
    [lockedRoleToFullDNMap_SAML] stanza to have different DNs with identical CNs
    map to different roles is not supported.
* Example: if this setting is "true" and you map a role in authentication.conf
  as follows:

  [roleMap_SAML]
  power=CN=PowerUsers

  and later, a SAML assertion arrives with the following DN:
  CN=PowerUsers,OU=Americas,DC=splunkcorp,DC=com

  then the auth system logs in the user who presented this assertion,
  writes an entry to authentication.conf like the following:

  [lockedRoleToFullDNMap_SAML]
  power=CN=PowerUsers,OU=Americas,DC=splunkcorp,DC=com

  and rejects further login attempts from users that present an assertion with
  the same CN ("CN=PowerUsers"), that is part of a different DN (for example,
  "CN=PowerUsers,OU=EMEA,DC=splunkcorp,DC=com",
  rather than "CN=PowerUsers,OU=Americas,DC=splunkcorp,DC=com").
* Default: true

allowPartialSignatures = <boolean>
* OPTIONAL
* When enabled, the Splunk authentication system only requires the SAML assertion block to be
  signed (but not necessarily the entire SAML response).
* When disabled, the entire SAML response must be signed for the login to succeed.
* Defaults to 'true'

#####################
# Map roles
#####################

[roleMap_<saml-authSettings-key>]
* The mapping of Splunk roles to SAML groups for the SAML stanza specified
  by '<authSettings-key>'.
* If a SAML group is not explicitly mapped to a Splunk role, but has
  the same name as a valid Splunk role then for ease of configuration,
  it is auto-mapped to that Splunk role.
* Follow this stanza name with several Role-to-Group(s) mappings as defined
  below.

<Splunk RoleName> = <SAML group string>
* Maps a Splunk role (from authorize.conf) to SAML groups
* This SAML group list is semicolon delimited (no spaces).
* List several of these setting/value pairs to map several Splunk roles to
  SAML Groups.
* If the role mapping is not specified, Splunk expects Splunk roles in the
  assertion and attribute query response returned from the IDP.

#####################
# SAML User Roles Map
#####################

[userToRoleMap_<saml-authSettings-key>]
* The mapping of SAML user to Splunk roles, real names, and emails,
  for the SAML stanza specified by '<authSettings-key>'.
* Follow this stanza name with several User-to-Role::Realname::Email mappings
  as defined below.
* The auth system uses this stanza only in the following scenarios:
  * The IdP that the auth system interacts with supports neither Attribute Query Requests nor authentication extension scripts.
  * The IdP does support authentication scripts, but the 'useAuthExtForTokenAuthOnly' setting has a value of "true".

<SAML User> = <Splunk Roles string>::<Realname>::<Email>
* Maps a SAML user to a Splunk role(from authorize.conf), real name, and email
* The Splunk Roles string is semicolon delimited (no spaces).
* The Splunk Roles string, Realname and Email are :: delimited (no spaces).

#####################
# Locked up map of roles to SAML group DNs
#####################

[lockedRoleToFullDNMap_<saml-authSettings-key>]
* This stanza is an output stanza that the Splunk auth system creates
  only under certain conditions.
* The stanza applies only if you have set 'lockRoleToFullDN' to "true".
  Nothing happens if 'lockRoleToFullDN' is "false".
* See the 'lockRoleToFullDN' setting for information on the acronyms that
  are used in this setting description.
* When the auth system receives a SAML assertion from an IdP that includes
  a group DN, it performs several checks:
  * First, it checks to see if the CN portion of the group DN that the IdP
    provided in the assertion is a match to any CN that you have configured
    in authentication.conf under the '[roleMap_SAML]' stanza.
  * If a CN matches, and you have not previously performed a mapping
    of SAML group DN to Splunk role, the auth system creates an entry underneath
    this stanza, in the following format:

    <Splunk role name> = <SAML group DN string>
  * This means that the auth system has locked the Splunk role name that
    you configured in the '[roleMap_SAML]' stanza to the DN that the IdP
    provided in the assertion.
  * After creating the entry, the auth system maps a user with the group
    DN that the IdP provided to the corresponding Splunk role and lets this
    user - and only this user - log in.
  * It then rejects users that present the same CN, but that do not provide a
    DN that exactly matches what was written under this stanza, for this
    Splunk role, on future login attempts.
  * It also writes a warning message to splunkd.log stating that the DN that
    the IdP presented has already been locked to a Splunk role.
  * Entries in this stanza map a Splunk role to a semicolon separated list of
    group DNs. DNs referenced in this stanza are enforced to have unique CNs
    (a CN cannot map to multiple DNs).

#####################
# Authentication Response Attribute Map
#####################

[authenticationResponseAttrMap_SAML]
* The Splunk platform expects emails, real names, and roles to be returned as SAML
  attributes in SAML assertion. This stanza can be used to map attribute names
  to what is expected. These are optional settings, and are only needed for
  certain IDPs.

#####################

[roleMap_proxySSO]
* The mapping of Splunk roles to groups passed in headers from the proxy server.
* If a group is not explicitly mapped to a Splunk role, but has
  the same name as a valid Splunk role, then, for ease of configuration, it is
  auto-mapped to that Splunk role.
* Follow this stanza name with several Role-to-Group(s) mappings as defined
  later in this section.

<Splunk RoleName> = <Group string>
* Maps a Splunk role (from authorize.conf) to one or more groups.

* Use an instance-specific string as a namespace within secret storage.
* When using GNOME keyring, this namespace is used as a keyring name.
* If multiple Splunk instances must store separate sets of secrets within the
  same storage backend, customize this value to be unique for each
  Splunk instance.
* Default: splunk

#####################
# Duo Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) vendor settings
#####################
[<duo-externalTwoFactorAuthSettings-key>]
* <duo-externalTwoFactorAuthSettings-key> must be the value listed in the
  'externalTwoFactorAuthSettings' setting, specified in the [authentication]
  stanza.
* This stanza contains Duo specific multifactor authentication settings and is
  activated only when you set 'externalTwoFactorAuthVendor' to "Duo".
* All the following settings, except 'appSecretKey', are provided by Duo.

apiHostname = <string>
* Duo's API endpoint which performs the actual multifactor authentication.
* Example: apiHostname = api-xyz.duosecurity.com
* Required.
* No default.

ecdhCurves = <comma separated list of ec curves>
* ECDH curves to use for ECDH key negotiation.
* This setting is optional.
* Default: The value of 'ecdhCurves' in the server.conf file

sslVerifyServerCert = <boolean>
* If set to true, the Splunk platform confirms the server that is
  being connected to is a valid server (authenticated).
* Both the common name and the alternate name of the server are then
  checked for a match, if they are specified in this configuration file.
* A certificate is considered verified if either is matched.
* This setting is optional.
* Default: false

sslVerifyServerName = <boolean>
* Whether or not splunkd, as a client, performs a TLS hostname validation check
  on an SSL certificate that it receives upon an initial connection
  to a server.
* A TLS hostname validation check ensures that a client
  communicates with the correct server, and has not been redirected to
  another by a machine-in-the-middle attack, where a malicious party inserts
  themselves between the client and the target server, and impersonates
  that server during the session.
* Specifically, the validation check forces splunkd to verify that either
  the Common Name or the Subject Alternate Name in the certificate that the
  server presents to the client matches the host name portion of the URL that
  the client used to connect to the server.
* For this setting to have any effect, the 'sslVerifyServerCert' setting must
  have a value of "true". If it doesn't, TLS hostname validation is not possible
  because certificate verification is not on.
* A value of "true" for this setting means that splunkd performs a TLS hostname
  validation check, in effect, verifying the server's name in the certificate.
  If that check fails, splunkd terminates the SSL handshake immediately. This terminates
  the connection between the client and the server. Splunkd logs this failure at
  the ERROR logging level.
* A value of "false" means that splunkd does not perform the TLS hostname
  validation check. If the server presents an otherwise valid certificate, the
  client-to-server connection proceeds normally.
* Default: false

sslCommonNameToCheck = <commonName1>, <commonName2>, ...
* If set, the Splunk platform limits outbound Duo HTTPS connections
  to a host which use a certificate with one of the listed common names.
* 'sslVerifyServerCert' must be set to "true" for this setting to work.
* This setting is optional.
* No default.

sslAltNameToCheck =  <alternateName1>, <alternateName2>, ...
* If set, the Splunk platform limits outbound duo HTTPS connections
  to host which use a certificate with one of the listed alternate names.
* 'sslVerifyServerCert' must be set to true for this setting to work.
* This setting is optional.
* No default.

sslRootCAPath = <path>
* The full path of a PEM format file containing one or more
  root CA certificates concatenated together.

  returned by the Duo server.
* This setting is optional.
* No default.

useClientSSLCompression = <boolean>
* Whether or not compression is enabled between the Splunk instance and a Duo server.
* If set to "true" on client side, compression is enabled between the server and client
  as long as the server also supports it.
* If not set, the Splunk platform uses the client SSL compression setting provided in server.conf
* This setting is optional.
* Default: false

enableMfaAuthRest = <boolean>
* Determines whether splunkd requires Duo multifactor authentication against REST endpoints.
* When Duo multifactor authentication is enabled for REST endpoints, you must log in to
  the Splunk platform instance with a valid Duo multifactor authentication factor to get a 
  valid session key, or requests to those endpoints must include a valid session key 
  in the following format:
  'curl -k -H "Authorization:Splunk sessionKey" -X GET <resource>'
* A value of "true" means splunkd requires Duo multifactor authentication against REST endpoints.
* A value of "false" means splunkd does not require Duo multifactor authentication against REST endpoints.
* Optional.
* Default: false

#####################
# RSA MFA vendor settings
#####################
[<rsa-externalTwoFactorAuthSettings-key>]
* <rsa-externalTwoFactorAuthSettings-key> must be the value listed in the
  externalTwoFactorAuthSettings setting specified in the [authentication]
  stanza.
* This stanza contains RSA-specific multifactor authentication settings and is
  activated only when you set 'externalTwoFactorAuthVendor' to "RSA".
* All the following settings can be obtained from RSA Authentication Manager 8.2 SP1.

authManagerUrl = <string>
* URL of the REST endpoint of RSA Authentication Manager.
* The Splunk platform sends authentication requests to this URL.
* Specify a HTTPS-based URL. the Splunk platform does not support communication over HTTP.
* Required.
* No default.

accessKey = <string>
* Access key needed by the Splunk platform to communicate with RSA Authentication Manager.
* Required.
* No default.

clientId = <string>
* The clientId is the agent name created on RSA Authentication Manager.
* Required.
* No default.

failOpen = <boolean>
* Whether or not the Splunk platform allows login if the RSA MFA server is unavailable.
* If set to "true", allow login in case authentication server is unavailable.
* This setting is optional.
* Default: false

timeout = <integer>
* The connection timeout, in seconds, for the outbound HTTPS connection to the RSA
  server.
* This setting is optional.
* Default: 5

messageOnError = <string>
* The message that the Splunk platform shows to the user in the case of a login failure.
* You can specify contact of admin or link to a diagnostic page.
* This setting is optional.
* No default.

sslVersions = <versions_list>
* Comma-separated list of SSL versions to support for incoming connections.
* The versions available are "ssl3", "tls1.0", "tls1.1", and "tls1.2".
* If not set, the Splunk platform uses the value of 'sslVersions' in server.conf.
* This setting is optional.
* Default: tls1.2

cipherSuite = <cipher suite string>
* If set, the Splunk platform uses the specified cipher string for the HTTP server.
* If not set, the Splunk platform uses the value for 'cipherSuite' specified in server.conf
* This setting is optional.

ecdhCurves = <comma separated list of ec curves>
* ECDH curves to use for ECDH key negotiation.
* This setting is optional.
* Default: The value of 'ecdhCurves' in the server.conf file

sslVerifyServerCert = <boolean>
* Determines whether to verify the server being connected to is authenticated.
* If this is set to true, you should make sure that the server that is
  being connected to is a valid one (authenticated). Both the common
  name and the alternate name of the server are then checked for a
  match if they are specified in this configuration file.  A
  certificate is considered verified if either is matched.
* This setting is optional.
* Default: true

sslVerifyServerName = <boolean>
* Whether or not splunkd, as a client, performs a TLS hostname validation check
  on an SSL certificate that it receives upon an initial connection
  to a server.
* A TLS hostname validation check ensures that a client
  communicates with the correct server, and has not been redirected to
  another by a machine-in-the-middle attack, where a malicious party inserts
  themselves between the client and the target server, and impersonates
  that server during the session.
* Specifically, the validation check forces splunkd to verify that either
  the Common Name or the Subject Alternate Name in the certificate that the
  server presents to the client matches the host name portion of the URL that
  the client used to connect to the server.
* For this setting to have any effect, the 'sslVerifyServerCert' setting must
  have a value of "true". If it doesn't, TLS hostname validation is not possible
  because certificate verification is not on.
* A value of "true" for this setting means that splunkd performs a TLS hostname
  validation check, in effect, verifying the server's name in the certificate.
  If that check fails, splunkd terminates the SSL handshake immediately. This terminates
  the connection between the client and the server. Splunkd logs this failure at
  the ERROR logging level.
* A value of "false" means that splunkd does not perform the TLS hostname
  validation check. If the server presents an otherwise valid certificate, the
  client-to-server connection proceeds normally.
* Default: false

sslCommonNameToCheck = <commonName1>, <commonName2>, ...
* If this value is set, the Splunk platform limits outbound RSA HTTPS connections
  to host which use a cert with one of the listed common names.
* 'sslVerifyServerCert' must be set to true for this setting to work.
* This setting is optional.
* No default.

sslAltNameToCheck =  <alternateName1>, <alternateName2>, ...
* If this value is set, the Splunk platform limits outbound RSA HTTPS connections
  to host which use a cert with one of the listed alternate names.
* 'sslVerifyServerCert' must be set to true for this setting to work.
* This setting is optional.
* No default.


sslRootCAPath = <path>
* The <path> must refer to full path of a PEM format file containing one or more
  root CA certificates concatenated together.
* Required.
* This Root CA must match the CA in the certificate chain of the SSL certificate
  returned by RSA server.
* No default.

sslVersionsForClient = <versions_list>
* Comma-separated list of SSL versions to support for outgoing HTTP connections.
* If not set, Splunk uses the value for 'sslVersionsForClient' in server.conf.
* This setting is optional.
* Default: tls1.2

replicateCertificates = <boolean>
* Whether or not RSA certificate files are automatically replicated across search head
  cluster nodes.
* If set to "true", RSA certificate files are replicated across nodes in a search head
  cluster.
* If disabled, RSA certificate files need to be replicated manually across SHC or else
  MFA verification fails.
* This setting has no effect if search head clustering is disabled.
* Default: true

enableMfaAuthRest = <boolean>
* Determines whether splunkd requires RSA two-factor authentication against REST endpoints.
* When two-factor authentication is enabled for REST endpoints, either you
  must log in to the Splunk instance with a valid RSA passcode, or requests
  to those endpoints must include a valid token in the following format:
  "curl -k -u <username>:<password>:<token> -X GET <resource>"
* If set to "true", splunkd requires RSA REST two-factor authentication.
* If set to "false", splunkd does not require REST two-factor authentication.
* This setting is optional.
* Default: false
