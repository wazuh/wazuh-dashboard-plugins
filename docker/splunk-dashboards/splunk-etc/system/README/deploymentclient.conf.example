# Example 1
# Deployment client receives apps and places them into the same
# repositoryLocation (locally, relative to $SPLUNK_HOME) as it picked them
# up from. This is typically $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps.  There
# is nothing in [deployment-client] because the deployment client is not
# overriding the value set on the deployment server side.

# Example 2
# Deployment server keeps apps to be deployed in a non-standard location on
# the server side (perhaps for organization purposes).
# Deployment client receives apps and places them in the standard location.
# Note: Apps deployed to any location other than
# $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps on the deployment client side will
# not be recognized and run.
# This configuration rejects any location specified by the deployment server
# and replaces it with the standard client-side location.
