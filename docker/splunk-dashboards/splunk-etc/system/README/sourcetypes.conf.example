# This file contains an example sourcetypes.conf.  Use this file to configure
# sourcetype models.
#
# NOTE: sourcetypes.conf is a machine-generated file that stores the document
# models used by the file classifier for creating source types.
#
# Generally, you should not edit sourcetypes.conf, as most attributes are
# machine generated.  However, there are two attributes which you can change.
#
# To use one or more of these configurations, copy the configuration block into
# sourcetypes.conf in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/. You must restart Splunk
# to enable configurations.
#
# To learn more about configuration files (including precedence) please see the
