# FORMATTING
#########################
# - Adjacent tokens implicitly allow no whitespace.
# - All literals are case-insensitive.
# - Aside from reserved characters ("<>()|?*+") and <tokens>, everything else is taken literally.
#   Those characters need to be quoted.  use \"  to represent a quote.
# - Examples are now broken into a separate values -- example1,
#    example2, example3.  If there's a text comment that goes with
#    exampleN then it should be in the commentN attribute.  For example:
#    "example2 = 5d" "comment2 = 5 days"
# - The only reserved characters are "<>()|?*+",
# - Whitespace (including newlines) matches \s+
# - Regex-like grouping
#      (): grouping
#      <term> : <term> is required
#      (<term>)? : <term> is optional
#      (<term>)* : <term> is optional and repeated 0 or more times
#      (<term>)+ : <term> is required and repeated 1 or more times
# - <terms> can be named for readability with a colon and a default value
#    "move <field:fromfield=localhost> to <field:tofield=localhost>"

# SIMPLE SYNTAX
#########################
# - To simplify the bnf for the end user, an optional "simplesyntax" can be specified,
# - To remove things like (m|min|mins|minute|minutes) so that the bnf becomes understandable
# - Potentially can be used to remove obscure/rarely used features
#     of search commands, but that should be done sparingly and with some thought.
#########################
# DESCRIPTION FORMATTING
#########################
# - For a command's DESCRIPTION, when automatically converted to html:
#   - multiple whitespace are removed
#   - for convenience, \p\ will cause a paragraph break and \i\ a newline and indent (<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)
#   - <terms> are italicized, UPPERCASETERMS and quoted terms are put into <code/>

shortdesc = Computes an "unexpectedness" score for an event.
description = Determines the degree of "unexpectedness" of an event's field \
    value, based on the previous MAXVALUE events.  By default it \
    removes events that are well-expected (unexpectedness > \
    THRESHOLD). The default THRESHOLD is 0.01.  If LABELONLY is true, \
    no events are removed, and the "unexpectedness" attribute is set \
    on all events.  The FIELD analyzed by default is "_raw".  \
    By default, NORMALIZE is true, which normalizes numerics.  For cases \
    where FIELD contains numeric data that should not be normalized, but \
    treated as categories, set NORMALIZE=false. The \
    DENYLIST is a name of a csv file of events in \
    $SPLUNK_HOME/var/run/splunk/<DENYLIST>.csv, such that any incoming \
    events that are similar to the denylisted events are treated as \
    not anomalous (i.e., uninteresting) and given an unexpectedness \
    score of 0.0.  Events that match denylisted events with a \
    similarity score above DENYLISTTHRESHOLD (defaulting to 0.05) are \
    marked as unexpected.  The inclusion of a 'by' clause, allows the \
    specification of a list of fields to segregate results for anomaly \
    detection.  For each combination of values for the specified \
    field(s), events with those values are treated entirely separately. \
    Therefore, 'anomalies by source' will look for anomalies in each \
    source separately -- a pattern in one source will not affect that \
    it is anomalous in another source.

[anomalousvalue-command]

shortdesc = Finds and summarizes irregular, or uncommon, search results.

description = Parameters to the anomalousvalue command.  \
              minsupcount is the minimum number of rows that must contain a field in order to consider the field at all. \
              maxanofreq is the maximum frequency (as a decimal) for a value to be considered anomalous. \
              minsupfreq is the minimum support frequency.  A field must be in at least this fraction of overall events to be considered. \
              minnormfreq is the minimum normal frequency.  A field's values must be considered normal at least this fraction of times \

[anomalydetection-command]
syntax = anomalydetection <anoma-method-option>? <anoma-action-option>? <anoma-pthresh-option>? <anoma-cutoff-option>? <field-list>?
shortdesc = Find anomalous events in a set of search results.
description = Identify anomalous events by computing a probability for each event and then detecting unusually small probabilities. \
              The probability is defined as the product of the frequencies of each individual field value in the event. \
              For categorical fields, the frequency of a value X is the number of times X occurs divided by the total number of events. \
              For numerical fields, we first build a histogram for all the values, then compute the frequency of a value X \
              as the size of the bin that contains X divided by the number of events. \
              Missing values are treated by adding a special value and updating its count just like a normal value. \
              Histograms are built using the standard Scott's rule to determine the bin width. \
              The way probabilities are computed is called the Naive Bayes method, which means the individual fields are considered independent. \
              This is a simplification to make the command reasonably fast.

[anoma-method-option]
syntax = method=(histogram|zscore|iqr)
description = There are three methods instead of one because we've combined two older commands, anomalousvalue and outlier, with the new method. \
              The new method is invoked by choosing the 'histogram' option. The anomalousvalue command is invoked by choosing 'zscore', \
              and the outlier command is invoked by choosing 'iqr'. \
              Below we will describe other options associated with the histogram method. For the other two methods, the associated options are \
              exactly the same as before. That is, the queries '...| anomalousvalue ...' and '...| anomalydetection method=zscore ...' where the '...' are \
              exactly the same in the two queries will produce exactly the same outputs. The same scheme applies to outlier.
example1 = ... | anomalydetection method=zscore action=filter pthresh=0.05
comment1 = This query returns the same output as that returned by the query '... | anomalousvalue action=filter pthresh=0.05'.

description = If the method is zscore or iqr, then the actions have the same meaning as in the anomalousvalue and outlier commands. \
              If the method is histogram, then the meanings are:\
              If action is FILTER, anomalous events are retained while others are dropped. \
              If action is ANNOTATE, new fields will be added to anomalous events that indicate the probability of the event as well as which field \
              may be the cause of the anomaly. \
              If the action is SUMMARY, a table summarizing the anomaly statistics for the search results is generated.
default = "action=filter"
comment = This is the default action when method=histogram. If method is zscore or iqr, then the default action is the default ones for those commands, \
          i.e., 'filter' for zscore and 'transform' for iqr

[anoma-pthresh-option]
syntax = pthresh=<num>
description = First, this option only applies when the method is either histogram or zscore. An invalid argument error will be returned if the method is iqr. \
              In the histogram case, it means the probability (as a decimal) that has to be met for an event to be deemed anomalous. \
              In the zscore case, it means the same as in the annomalousvalue command.
default = If the method is zscore, then the default is 0.01 (as in the anomalousvalue command). If the method is histogram, the default is not any fixed value \
          but is instead calculated for each data set during the analysis.

[anoma-cutoff-option]
syntax = cutoff=<bool>
description = This option applies to histogram method only. If the cutoff is false, the algorithm uses the formula threshold = 1st-quartile - 1.5*iqr without \

         the conf, the more significant the associations will be, but at the expense of retaining less associations.

shortdesc   = Allows users to examine data models and search data model datasets.
description = Must be the first command in a search. When used with no \
              arguments, returns the JSON for all data models available in the \
              current context. When used with just a modelName, returns the \
              JSON for a single data model. When used with a modelName and \
              objectName, returns the JSON for a single data model dataset. \
              When used with modelName, objectName and 'dm-search-mode', runs  \
              the search for the specified search mode.\
              "allow_old_summaries": Only applies when you use 'datamodel' to \
              search an accelerated data model. Defaults to false. \
              When allow_old_summaries=false, the Splunk software only \
              provides results from TSIDX data model summary directories that \
              are up-to-date. In other words, if the data model definition has \
              changed, the Splunk software does not use data model summary \
              directories that are older than the current definition when it \
              returns 'datamodel' command output. This default ensures that \
              the output from the datamodel search command always reflects \
              your current configuration. When allow_old_summaries=true, the \
              'datamodel' command uses both current summary data and \
              summary data that was generated prior to a change to the data \
              model definition. This is an advanced performance feature for \
              cases where the old summaries are "good enough".\
              "summariesonly": Only applies when you use 'datamodel' to \
              search an accelerated data model. Defaults to false. When \
              summariesonly = false, the search generates results both \
              summarized and unsummarized data. For unsummarized data, the \
              search runs against the original indexed data. When \
              summariesonly = true, the search runs only against data model \
              summaries. It does not generate results from unsummarized data.\
              "strict_fields": Only applies when you use 'datamodel' to search\
              a data model. Defaults to true. When 'strict_fields = false', \
              the command returns all fields, rather than just the set of \
              fields that are defined within the constraints for the data \
              model. This includes fields inherited from parent data models \
              and fields that are derived through search-time processes such \

By default, Splunk ships with a special role, "can_delete" that has this capability (and no others). The admin role does not have this capability by default. Splunk recommends you create a special user that you log into when you intend to delete index data. \
              To use the delete operator, run a search that returns the events you want deleted. Make sure that this search ONLY returns events you want to delete, and no other events. Once you've confirmed that this is the data you want to delete, pipe that search to delete. \

comment15 = Takes a number and returns its natural log.
example16 = log(number, 2)
comment16 = Takes either one or two numeric arguments, returning the log of the first argument using the base provided by the second argument, in this case log of number base 2. The default base is 10 if the second argument is omitted.
example17 = lower(username)
comment17 = Takes one string argument and returns the lowercase version, in this example lowercasing the value provided by the field username. The upper function also exists for returning the uppercase version.
example18 = match(field, "^\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}$")
comment18 = Takes two string arguments, and returns true iff the first argument matches the regex provided by the second argument. This example returns true iff field matches the basic pattern of an ip address. Note that the example used ^ and $ to perform a full match.

comment22 = Takes two or three arguments, the first being a field and the second two being numbers, which returns a subset of the multivalued field using the indexes provided. For mvindex(mvfield, startindex, [endindex]) endindex is inclusive and optional. Both start and endindex can be negative, where -1 = last element, and if endindex is not specified, it returns just the value at startindex. If the indexes are out of range or invalid, the result is null. Since indexes start at zero, this example returns the third value in multifield if it exists.
example23 = mvfilter(match(email, "\.net$") OR match(email, "\.org$"))
comment23 = Takes one argument which is a boolean expression that references EXACTLY one field. It returns that multivalued field filtered by the given expression, so this example will return all values of the field email that end in .net or .org.
example24 = mvfind(mymvfield, "err\d+")

example30 = random()
comment30 = Takes no arguments, returns a pseudo-random number.
example31 = replace(date, "^(\d{1,2})/(\d{1,2})/", "\2/\1/")
comment31 = Takes three arguments - replace(input_string, regex_pattern_to_replace, replacement_string) returns the input string with all instances of the regex pattern replaced with the replacement string. You can also include matched groups in the third argument by escaping the group number matched. The example returns date with the month and day numbers switched, so if the input was 1/12/2009 the return value would be 12/1/2009.
example32 = round(3.5)
comment32 = Takes one or two numeric arguments, returning the first argument rounded to the amount of decimal places specified by the second. The default is to round to an integer, so the example would return 4. round(2.555, 2) would return 2.56.

example38 = substr("string", 1, 3) + substr("string", -3)
comment38 = Takes either two or three arguments - the first is a string and the last two are numeric. The function returns a substring of the first argument starting at the index specified by the second argument with the number of characters specified by the third. If a third argument is not given, it returns the rest of the string. The indexes follow SQLite semantics in that they start at 1 and negative indices can be used, which start from the end of the string. The example concatenates "str" and "ing" together, returning "string"
example39 = tostring(1==1) + " " + tostring(15, "hex") + " " + tostring(12345.6789, "commas")
comment39 = Takes one or two arguments, returning a string representation of the first argument with optional formatting for numbers. For numbers you can specify "hex" or "commas" as a second argument to format the number accordingly. The return value for this example is "True 0xF 12,345.68".
example40 = trim("   ZZZZabcZZ ", " Z")
comment40 = Takes one or two string arguments, and returns the first string with the characters in the second argument trimmed from both sides. If no second argument is specified, spaces and tabs are trimmed. This example returns "abc". There are also ltrim and rtrim functions for trimming only the left and right sides, respectively.

   file in the 'forms' subdirectory in all apps, e.g. $SPLUNK_HOME$/etc/apps/*/forms/.  \
   All the events processed would\
   be matched against that form, trying to extract values.\p\\
   If no FORM is specified, then the FIELD value determines the name of the field to\
   extract.  For example, if "field=error_code", then an event that has an error_code=404,\
   would be matched against a "404.form" file.\p\\
   The default value for FIELD is "sourcetype", thus by default kvform will look for \

             'tojson' processor outputs 'true' if the value is 'true', 't', or 'yes. If the string is neither of the above, it is skipped  \
              When a field contains multivalues, the 'tojson' processor outputs a JSON array where 'true' and 'false' values are \
              applied according to the preceding criteria. \
comment = Convert the field 'isInternal' into a JSON output. Apply the boolean type to that field.
example = ... | tojson bool(isInternal)

description = Convert all values for the specified field into the JSON type, using string validation. \
              If the value is a number, the 'tojson' processor outputs that number. If the value is a string, the 'tojson' \
              processor examines the string. If the string is valid JSON, the 'tojson' processor outputs the string as a JSON \
              block. If the field is invalid JSON, the 'tojson' processor skips it. \
              If the field contains multivalues, the 'tojson' processor outputs a JSON array where each element is evaluated and typed \
              according to the preceding criteria. \
comment = Convert the field 'test_inputs' into a JSON object. Apply the JSON type to that field.
example = ... | tojson json(test_inputs)

[tojson-none]
syntax = none("(" (<wc-field>)? ")")?
description = Output the values for the specified field in the JSON type, without string validation. \
              If the value is a number, the 'tojson' processor outputs a numeric type in the JSON block. If the value is a \
              string, the 'tojson' processor outputs a string. \
              If the field contains multivalues, the 'tojson' processor outputs a JSON array where each element of the array is \
              either a string or a number. \
comment = Convert the fields 'name' and 'age' into a JSON representation. Apply the none type to both fields.
example = ... | tojson none(name) none(age)

[tojson-command-arguments]
syntax = (fill_null=<bool>)? (include_internal=<bool>)? (output_field=<string>)? (default_type=<string>)?
description = 'fill_null' is a boolean argument that outputs a literal 'null' value when the 'tojson' processor skips a value. \
              For example, if the 'json' function is used on a field that does not have proper json, the 'tojson' processor \
              normally skips the field. However, when 'fill_null=true', the 'tojson' processor outputs a 'null' value for the \
              field. Defaults to false. \
              'include_internal' is a boolean argument that includes internal fields in the JSON output when it is set to true. \
              Defaults to false. \
              'output_field' specifies the field that 'tojson' processor should write the output JSON to. Defaults to '_raw'. \
              'default_type' specifies the function that the 'tojson' processor should apply to fields that don't explicitly \
              specify a function. Defaults to 'none'. \
comment1 = Convert the fields 'age','height', and 'weight' into number types, convert 'name' into a string type, and write the JSON to the field 'my_json_field'.
example1 = ... | tojson age height weight str(name) default_type=num output_field=my_json_field

[makeresults-data-option]
syntax      = data=<string>
description = Inline data that 'makeresults' converts into Splunk events. The data must have a JSON \
              or CSV format. \
              Inline data in JSON format must be provided as a series of JSON objects within a single \
              JSON array. Each JSON object corresponds to a separate event. For each JSON object, \
              keys become fields, and values become field values. Each JSON key must be escape-quoted. \
              The full JSON array must be placed around normal quotes. \
              Inline data in CSV format consists of a set of lines. The first line contains the schema, \
              or headers, for the CSV table. This first line consists of a comma-separated list of \
              strings where each string corresponds to a field name. The schema ends when a newline \
              character is reached. Each line that follows the schema line represents a single event, \
              with comma-separated field values. Use newlines to indicate the end of one event and the \
              beginning of another. Inline data searches cannot exceed a threshold of 30000 characters. \
              If you specify the 'data' argument, 'makeresults' ignores all other arguments (such as \
              'count' and 'annotate'). \

              ignores the 'create_context' argument. \p\\
              If 'create_empty' is true (the default) and no results are      \
              passed to 'outputlookup', 'ouputlookup' creates a 0-length      \

              the lookup file if it exists. If 'override_if_empty=f',         \
              'outputlookup' does not delete the existing lookup file. \p\\
              If 'key_field' is set to a valid field name and this is a       \
              KV store lookup, 'outputlookup' attempts to use the             \
              specified field as the key to a value and replace that          \
              value. \p\\
              If 'append' is true, 'outputlookup' attempts to append to an    \
              existing csv file if it exists or create a file if necessary.   \
              If there is an existing file that has a csv header already,     \
              'outputlookup' adds ohnly the fields that are referenced by     \
              that header. (Defaults to false). .gz files cannot be appended  \
              to. \

[pd-algo-option]
syntax = algorithm=(LL|LLT|LLP|LLP5|LLB|BiLL)
description = LL, LLT, LLP, and LLP5 are univariate algorithms. LLB and BiLL are bivariate algorithms.\
                LL is the simplest algorithm and computes the levels of the time series, ie. each new state\
                equals the previous state plus a Gaussian noise.\
                LLT computes the levels plus the trend.\
                LLP takes into account the data's periodicity if it exists. You can set the \
                period using the "period" option. You should set the period if you know it \
                because it will likely be more accurate than letting the command estimate the period.\
                If the you do not set the period, LLP will try to calculate it.\
                LLP5 combines LLT and LLP. If the time series is periodic, LLP5 computes two \
                predictions, one using LLT and the other using LLP. Then LLP5 takes a weighted \
                average of the two values and outputs that as its prediction. The confidence \
                interval is also based on a weighted average of the variances of the \
                LLT and LLP algorithms.\
                LLB and BiLL are both bivariate local level algorithms. LLB predicts \
                one time series off the other. BiLL predicts both time series simultaneously. \
                The key here is that the covariance of the two series is taken into account.\

[redistribute-command]
syntax = redistribute (num_of_reducers=<int>)? (<by-clause>)?
shortdesc = Speeds up search runtime of a set of supported SPL commands, in a \
          distributed search environment.
description = This command divides the search results \
          among a pool of intermediate reducers in the indexer layer. The reducers \
          perform intermediary reduce operations in parallel on the search results \
          before pushing them up to the search head, where a final reduction \
          operation is performed. This parallelization of reduction work that \
          would otherwise be done entirely by the search head can result in \
          faster completion times for high-cardinality searches that \
          aggregate large numbers of search results. \p\\
          Set num_of_reducers to control the number of intermediate reducers \
          used from the pool. num_of_reducers defaults to a fraction of the \
          indexer pool size, according to the 'winningRate' setting, and is \
          limited by the 'maxReducersPerPhase' setting, both of which are \
          specified on the search head in the [parallelreduce] stanza of \
          limits.conf. \p\\
          The redistribute command divides events into partitions on the \
          intermediate reducers according to the fields specified with the \
          by-clause. If no by-clause fields are specified, the search \
          processor uses the fields that work best with the commands that \
          follow the redistribute command in the search. \p\\
          The prjob command provides the same functionality as the redistribute \
          command but with a simpler interface as it uses the default \
          parameter values for num_of_reducers and the by-clause. Consider \
          using the prjob command when you do not need to specify the \
          parameter values. \p\\
          The redistribute command requires a distributed search environment \
          with a pool of intermediate reducers at the indexer level. You can \
          use the redistribute command only once in a search. \p\\
          The redistribute command supports streaming commands and the \
          following nonstreaming commands: stats, tstats, streamstats, \
          eventstats, sichart, and sitimechart. The redistribute command also \
          supports transaction on a single field. \p\\
          The redistribute command moves the processing of a search string \
          from the intermediate reducers to the search head when it \
          encounters nonstreaming command that it does not support or that \
          does not include a by-clause. The redistribute command also moves \
          processing to the search head when it detects that a command has \
          modified values of the fields specified in the redistribute by-clause. \p\\
          Note: When results are aggregated from the intermediate reducers at \
          the search head, a sort order is imposed on the result rows only \
          when an order-sensitive command such as 'sort' is in place to \
          consume the reducer output.
example1 = "... | redistribute by ip | stats count by ip"
comment1 = Speeds up a stats search that aggregates a large number of results. \
          The "| stats count by ip" portion of the search is processed on the \
          intermediate reducers. The search head just aggregates the results.
example2 = "... | redistribute | eventstats count by user, source | where  count>10 | sitimechart max(count) by source | timechart max(count) by source"
comment2 = Speeds up a search that includes eventstats and which uses \
          sitimechart to perform the statistical calculations for a timechart \
          operation. The intermediate reducers process eventstats, where, and \
          sitimechart. The search head runs timechart to turn the reduced \
          sitimechart statistics into sorted, visualization-ready results. \
          Because the redistribute split-by field is unidentified, the system \
          selects "source" as the redistribute field.
example3 = "| tstats prestats=t count BY _time span=1d | redistribute by _time | sitimechart span=1d count | timechart span=1d count"
comment3 = Speeds up a search that uses tstats to generate events. The \
          tstats command must be placed at the start of the search pipeline, \
          and here it uses prestats=t to work with the timechart command. \
          sitimechart is processed on the reducers and timechart is processed on \
          the search head.
example4 = "... | redistribute | eventstats count by user, source | where count >10  | sort 0 -num(count) | ..."
comment4 = In this example, the eventstats and where commands are processed \
          in parallel on the reducers, while the sort command and any commands \
          following it are processed on the search head. This happens because \
          sort is a nonstreaming command that is not supported by redistribute.

[rtorder-command]
syntax = rtorder (discard=<bool>)? (buffer_span=<span-length>)? (max_buffer_size=<int>)?
shortdesc = Buffers events from real-time search to emit them in ascending time order when possible.
description = The rtorder command creates a streaming event buffer that takes input events, stores them \
              in the buffer in ascending time order. The events are emitted in that order from the \
              buffer only after the current time reaches at least the span of time given by buffer_span \
              after the timestamp of the event.  The buffer_span is by default 10 seconds. \
              Events are emitted from the buffer if the maximum size of the buffer is exceeded.\
              The default max_buffer_size is 50000, or the max_result_rows setting of the [search] \
              stanza in the limits.conf file.  If an event is received as input that is earlier \
             than an event that has been emitted previously, that out of order event is emitted \
              immediately unless the discard option is set to true (it is false by default). \
              When discard is set to true, out of order events are discarded, assuring that the \
             output is always strictly in time ascending order.
example1 = ... | rtorder discard=t buffer_span=5m
comment1 = Keep a buffer of the last 5 minutes of events, emitting events in ascending time order after \
           the events are more than 5 minutes old.  Newly received events that are older than 5 minutes \
           are discarded if an event after that time has already been emitted.

 command is executed, the previous search results are put into a\
 temporary database table called "results". If a row has no values,\
 "select" ignores it to prevent blank search results.

description = When set to "true", the Splunk software splits the data it \
              ingests via the 'collect' command into individual events, using \
              a string identical to the LINE_BREAKER setting defined for the \
              'stash_new' source type in props.conf. When set to 'false', the \
              Splunk software uses a simple line break to split events. Do not \
              use this setting unless you are intentionally generating events \
              with the 'collect' command in a line-oriented format. Defaults \
              to "true". Not a valid option for output_format=hec. \
              NOTE: While the default behavior of the 'collect' command is to \
              use a LINE_BREAKER setting identical to that used in props.conf, \
              the collect command's default LINE_BREAKER is hardcoded. Changes \

shortdesc   = Puts search results into a metric index on the search head.
description = Converts search results into metric data and inserts the data into a metric index \
              on the search head. If each result contains only one metric_name field \
              and one numeric _value field, the result is already a normalized metrics data point, \
              the result does not need to be split and can be consumed directly. \
              Otherwise, each result is spit into multiple metric data points based on the specified \
              list of dimension fields. \
              If the '_time' field is present in the results, it is used as the timestamp of the \
              metric datapoint. If the '_time' field is not present, the current time is used. \
              Arguments: \
              “index”: The index where the collected metric data are placed. This argument is required. \
              “file”: The file name where you want the collected metrics data to be written. \
              The default file name is a random filename. You can use a timestamp or a random number \
              for the file name by specifying either file=$timestamp$ or file=$random$. \
              Defaults to $random$_metrics.csv \
              “split”: Determines how mcollect identifies the measures in an event. Defaults to false. \
              When split=true, you use <field-list> to identify the dimensions in your search. The  \
              mcollect command converts any field in your search that is not part of the <field-list> \
              into a measurement. \
              When split=false, the measure field or fields need to be explicitly specified by the \
              search. \
                * If you have single-metric events, the search must produce results with a \
                  'metric_name' field for the name of the measure and a '_value' field for the \
                  measure's numeric value. \
                * If you have multiple-metric events, the search must produce results that include \
                  measures that follow this syntax: 'metric_name:<metric_name>=<numeric_value>'. \
              When split=allnums, mcollect treats all numeric fields as metric measures and all \
              non-numeric fields as dimensions. You can optionally use <field-list> to declare that \
              certain numeric fields in the events should be treated as dimensions. \
              “spool”: If spool=true (which is the default setting), the metrics data file is written \
              to the Splunk spool directory, $SPLUNK_HOME/var/spool/splunk, where the file is indexed \
              automatically. If spool=false, the file is written to the $SPLUNK_HOME/var/run/splunk \
              directory. The file remains in this directory unless some form of further automation \
              or administration is done. \
              “prefix_field”: Is applicable only when split=true. If specified, any event with that \
              field missing is ignored. Otherwise, the field value is prefixed to the metric name. \
              "host": The name of the host that you want to specify for the collected metrics data. \
              Only applicable when spool=true. \
              "source": The name of the source that you want to specify for the collected metrics data. \
              Defaults to the name of search. \
              "sourcetype": The name of the source type that is specified for the collected metrics \
              data. This setting defaults to mcollect_stash. License usage is not calculated for \
              data indexed with the mcollect_stash source type. If you change to a different \
              source type, the Splunk platform calculates license usage for any data indexed \
              by the mcollect command. NOTE: Do not change this setting without \
              assistance from Splunk Professional Services or Splunk Support. Changing the \
              source type requires a change to the props.conf file. \
              “marker”: Optional. A string of one or more comma-separated key-value pairs. The Splunk \
                        software adds these key-value pairs to the metric data points in the summary \
                        metric index, so you can use them as markers for easy identification in future \
                        searches of the metric index where they reside. Defaults to empty. \
              “field-list”: A list of dimension fields. Optional if split=false (the default), required \
              if split=true. If “field-list” is not specified, all fields are treated as dimensions \
              for the data point except for the “prefix_field” and internal fields (fields with an \
              underscore ’_’ prefix). If “field-list” is specified, the list must be specified \
              at the end of the mcollect command arguments.  If “field-list” is specified, all \
              fields are treated as metric values, except for fields in “field-list”, \
              the “prefix-field”, and internal fields. \
              The name of each metric value is the field name prefixed with the ”prefix_field” value. \
              Effectively, one metric data point is returned for each qualifying field that \
              contains a numerical value. If one search result contains multiple qualifying \
              metric name/value pairs, the result is split into multiple metric data points.

                * If you have multiple-metric events, the search must produce results that include \
                  measures that follow this syntax: 'metric_name:<metric_name>=<numeric_value>'. \
              “spool”: If spool=true (which is the default setting), the metrics data file is written \
              to the Splunk spool directory, $SPLUNK_HOME/var/spool/splunk, where the file is indexed \
              automatically. If spool=false, the file is written to the $SPLUNK_HOME/var/run/splunk \
              directory. The file remains in this directory unless some form of further automation \
              or administration is done. \
              “prefix_field”: Is applicable only when split=true. If specified, any event with that \
              field missing is ignored. Otherwise, the field value is prefixed to the metric name. \
              "host": The name of the host that you want to specify for the collected metrics data. \
              Only applicable when spool=true. \
              "source": The name of the source that you want to specify for the collected metrics data. \
              Defaults to the name of search. \
              "sourcetype": The name of the source type that is specified for the collected metrics \
              data. This setting defaults to mcollect_stash. License usage is not calculated for \
              data indexed with the mcollect_stash source type. If you change to a different \
              source type, the Splunk platform calculates license usage for any data indexed \
              by the meventcollect command. NOTE: Do not change this setting \
              without assistance from Splunk Professional Services or Splunk Support. Changing \
              the source type requires a change to the props.conf file. \
              “field-list”: A list of dimension fields. Optional if split=false (the default), required \
              if split=true. If “field-list” is not specified, all fields are treated as dimensions \
              for the data point except for the “prefix_field” and internal fields (fields with an \
              underscore ’_’ prefix). If “field-list” is specified, the list must be specified \
              at the end of the meventcollect command arguments.  If “field-list” is specified, all \
              fields are treated as metric values, except for fields in “field-list”, \
              the “prefix-field”, and internal fields. \
              The name of each metric value is the field name prefixed with the ”prefix_field” value. \
              Effectively, one metric data point is returned for each qualifying field that \
              contains a numerical value. If one search result contains multiple qualifying \
              metric name/value pairs, the result is split into multiple metric data points.

description = Rollup metric data in to another index for storage/search performance improvements. \
              Arguments: \
              “source”: The index where the metric data are placed. This is the source index \
              holding the raw data which needs to be summarized in to a target index. \
              This argument is required. \

              “file”: The spool file name where you want the collected metrics data to be written. \
              “span”: Rollup span as a timespan string. The span in minutes has to be a factor \
              of 60 and in hours should be a factor of 24. Max allowed is 24h or 1d and minimum \
              is controlled by limits.conf [rollup]/minSpanAllowed setting. A span less than a \
              minute is not allowed. \
              “aggregate”: The aggregate stats function to be used to perform rollup. \
              Valid aggregations supported are avg, count, max, perc<int>, median, min and sum. \
              This argument can take single stats function or a "#" separated stats function list. \
              “dimension-list”: The list of dimensions that was part of the source index metric \
              data that needs to either excluded or included as defined by dimension-list-type. \
              Reducing the dimension will reduce the amount of data stored leading to better storage \
              and faster search response. Default is all included or nothing excluded. \
              “dimension-list-type”: The type of input dimension list. Used along with \
              dimension-list argument. Possible values include "excluded" or \
              "included". Default is "excluded". \
              “metric-list”: The list of metrics that was part of the source index metric \
              data that needs to either excluded or included as defined by metric-list-type. \
              Reducing the metric will reduce the amount of data stored leading to better storage \
              and faster search response. Default is all included or nothing excluded. \
              “metric-list-type”: The type of input metric list. Used along with \
              metric-list argument. Possible values include "excluded" or \
              "included". Default is "excluded". \
              “metrics-overrides”: Comma separated list of metric name and \
              aggregate pairs. Each pair is delimited by a semi colon character. \
              If unspecified all the metric names takes on the 'aggreagate' stats function \
              by default. If overrided then for those metrics it will use the specified \
              aggregation stats function. Valid aggregations supported are avg, count, \
              max, perc<int>, median, min and sum. The aggregation stats function can be \
              a single stats function or a "#" separated stats function list. \
              “app“: Optional argument to add a 'rollup_app' dimension to the summary data \
              in the target index. The 'rollup_app' dimension gets the value provided for \
              this argument. Ideally the 'app' value is the name of the app to which the \
              the related metric rollup policy belongs. If this argument is missing, 'mrollup' \
              will not add the dimension.

shortdesc = Adds summary statistics to all search results in a streaming manner.
description = Similar to the 'eventstats' command except that only events seen before \
        the current event (plus that event itself if current=t, which is the default) \
        are used to compute the aggregate statistics that are applied to each event. \p\\
        The 'window' option specifies the window size, based on number of events, to \
        use in computing the statistics. If set to 0, the default, all previous events \
        and the current event are used. If the 'global' option is set to false \
        (default is true) and 'window' is set to a non-zero value, a separate window \
        is used for each group of values of the group by fields. \p\\
        The 'allnum' option has the same affect as for the stats and eventstats \
        commands. \p\\
        If the reset_on_change option is set to true (default is false), all \
        accumulated information is reset (as if no previous events have been seen) \
        whenever the group by fields change. Events that do not have all of the \
        group by fields are ignored and will not cause a reset. \p\\
        The reset_before and reset_after arguments use boolean eval expressions. \
        When these expressions evaluated on a event either before or after \
        (respectively) the streamstats is calculation applied, will reset the \
        accumulated information. The reset_after condition might reference \
        fields emitted by the streamstats operation itself, whereas the reset_before \
        condition might not. When the reset options are combined with the 'window' \
        option, the window is also reset (to as if no previous events have been seen) \
        whenever the accumulated statistics are reset.\p\\
        If 'time_window' is specified, the window size limited by the range of _time \
        values in a window. A maximum number of events in a window still applies for \
        a time-based window. The default maximum is set in the max_stream_window \
        attribute in the limits.conf file. You can lower the maximum by specifying \
        the 'window' option.  The time_window option requires \
        the input events be sorted in either ascending or descending time order.

              The 'partitions' option, if specified, allows stats to partition the \

note =  When called without any arguments, stats assumes the argument "default(*)".\

shortdesc = Annotates specified fields in your search results with tags.
description = Annotates the search results with tags. If there are specified \
  fields, the command annotates tags only for those fields. Otherwise, it looks \
  for tags for all fields. If 'outputfield' is specified, the command writes \
  the tags for all fields to this field.  Otherwise, it writes the tags for \
  each field to a field named tag::<field>. If you specify 'outputfield', \
  'inclname' and 'inclvalue' control whether the field name and field values \
  are added to the output field.  By default only the tag itself is written to \
  the outputfield. E.g.: (<field>::)?(<value>::)?tag \
  If 'allowed_tags' is specified, the command returns only the tags in the \
  'allowed_tags' argument. You can specify multiple tags in the 'allowed_tags' \
  argument as a comma-separated, double-quoted string. \\p

              In addition to the <bin-options>: \
              The usenull option controls whether or not a series is \
              created for events that do not contain the split-by field. \
              This series is labeled by the value of the nullstr option, and defaults to NULL. \
              The useother option specifies if a series should be added for data series not \
              included in the graph because they did not meet the criteria of the <where-clause>. \
              This series is labeled by the value of the otherstr option, and defaults to OTHER.

description = In addition to the standard bin-options, the timechart command includes another \
              bin-option called <snap-to-time>. The <snap-to-time> is a span of each bin, based \
              on a relative time unit and a snap to time unit. The <snap-to-time> must include a \
              relative_time_unit, the @ symbol, and a snap_to_time_unit. The offset, represented \
              by the plus (+) or minus (-) is optional. If the <time_integer> is not specified, \
              1 is the default. For example if you specify w as the relative_time_unit, \
              1 week is assumed. This option is used only with week time units. It cannot be \
              used with other time units such as minutes or quarters.

[where-clause]
syntax = where <single-agg> <where-comp>
description = Specifies the criteria for including particular data series when a field is given in the tc-by-clause. \
              This optional clause, if omitted, default to "where sum in top10". \
              The aggregation term is applied to each data series and the result of \
              these aggregations is compared to the criteria. \
              The most common use of this option is to select for spikes rather than overall \
              mass of distribution in series selection. The default value finds the \
              top ten series by area under the curve. Alternately one could replace sum with \
              max to find the series with the ten highest spikes.
note = This has no relation to the where-command or SQLite.

description = Performs statistics on the measurement, metric_name, and  \
              dimension fields in metric indexes. The mstats command is \
              optimized for searches over one or more metric_name values, \
              rather than searches over all metric_name values. It supports \
              both historical and real-time searches. For a real-time search \
              with a time window, mstats runs a historical search first that \
              backfills the data.\p\\
              The mstats command is a generating command, except when it is \
              in 'append=t' mode. As such, it must be the first command in a \
              search.\p\\
        In 'chart=t' mode, the output is formatted in format suitable for \
              charting, similar to the chart and timechart commands. \
        Charting mode is not compatible with append mode or prestats mode.\p\\
        If the <stats-func> based syntax is used, the filter specified after \
        the WHERE clause cannot filter on metric_name. Any metric_name \
        filtering is performed based on the metric_name fields specified \
        by the <stats-func> argument.  If the <stats-func-value> syntax \
        is used, the WHERE clause *must* filter on metric_name (wildcards are ok). \
              It is recommended to use the <stats-func> syntax when possible.  \
        The <stats-func-value> syntax is needed for cases where a single metric may be \
              represented by several different metric names (e.g. "cpu.util" and "cpu.utilization"). \p\\
              You cannot blend the <stats-func> syntax with the <stats-func-value> syntax in a single mstats command. \p\\
              Arguments: \p\\
              "<stats-func>": A list of stats functions to compute for given  \

                        <function1>(metric_name1) <function2>(metric_name2) ... \p\\
              "<stats-func-value>": A list of stats functions to compute on \
                  metric values (_value).  These are written as \
                        <function1>(_value) <function2>(_value) ... \p\\
              "<logical-expression>": An expression describing the filters \
                        that are applied to your search. Includes time and \
                        search modifiers, comparison expressions, and index \
                        expressions. This expression cannot filter on \
                        metric_name if the <stats-func> syntax is used, but \
      must filter on metric_name if the <stats-func-value> \
      syntax is used.\p\\
              "<field-list>": Specifies one or more fields to group the \
                        results by. Required when using the 'BY' or \
                        'GROUPBY' clause. \p\\
              "prestats": Returns the results in prestats format. You can pipe \
                        the results into commands that consume the prestats \
                        formatted data, such as chart or timechart, and \
                        output aggregate calculations. This is useful for \
                        creating graphs. Default is prestats=false. \p\\
              "append": Valid only when "prestats=true". This argument adds \
                        the results of the mstats run to an existing set of \
                        results instead of generating new results. Default is \
                        "append=false". \p\\
        "chart":  Valid only when "prestats=false".  When set to "true", \
                        the mstats command emits output in a format similar to \
      chart (when no span given) and timechart (when span is given). \
      When no span is provided, chart mode requires specifying \
      one or two grouping fields, the first of which specifies \
      the x-axis field, and the latter the series split field. \
      When a span is provided, chart mode supports at most one \
      groupby field, which would be used as the series splitting \
      field.  Default is "chart=false". \p\\
      The options that start with "chart." are only valid in charting mode (chart=true). \p\\
        "chart.limit":  Limits for the number of series \
            (columns) generated.  Same behavior as the chart/timechart \
      limit option.  0 means no limit.  Optionally prefixed by "top" or \
      "bottom" to determine which series to select.  A number without a prefix \
      means the same thing as having "top" as the prefix.  Default is 10. \p\\
        "chart.agg":    Specifies the aggregation \
            functions used to select which series to show.  Same behavior \
      as the chart/timechart agg option.  Default is "sum". \p\\
        chart.("usenull"/"nullstr"/"useother"/"otherstr"):  Same behavior as \
            chart/timechart options of the same name. \p\\
              "backfill": Valid only with windowed real-time searches. When \
                        set to "true", the mstats command runs a historical \
                        search to backfill the on-disk indexed data before \
                        searching the in-memory real-time data. Default is \
                        "backfill=true".\p\\
              "update_period": Valid only with real-time searches. Specifies \
                  how frequently, in milliseconds, the real-time \
                        summary for the mstats command is updated. By \
                        default, update_period=0, which is 1 second. A \
                        larger number means less frequent reads of the \
                        summary and less impact on index processing.\p\\
              "fillnull_value": This argument sets a user-specified value \
                        that the mstats command substitutes for null values \
                        for any field within its group-by field list. Null \
                        values include field values that are missing from \
                        a subset of the returned events as well as field \
                        values that are missing from all of the returned \
                        events. If you do not provide a 'fillnull_value' \
                        argument, the tstats command omits rows for events \
                        with one or more null field values from its search \
                        results. \p\\
              "chunk_size": Advanced option. This argument controls how many timeseries \
                        are retrieved at a time within a single metric TSIDX file when \
                        answering queries. The default is 10000000. Only consider \
                        supplying a lower value for this if you find a particular \
                        query is using too much memory. The case that could cause \
                        this would be an excessively high cardinality split-by, such \
                        as grouping by several fields that have a very large amount of \
                        of distinct values. Setting this value too low, however, can \
                        negatively impact the overall runtime of your query. If set \
                        below 10000, the value will be defaulted to 10000000. \p\\
               "every": This argument controls how often the Splunk software computes \
                        an aggregation point using the aggregation window specified \
                        by the 'span' argument. When you use 'every' along with 'span', \
                        you can skip values by searching discrete time intervals. \
                        The 'every' argument is valid only when 'span' is set to a \
                        valid value other than 'auto'. Set 'every' to a valid timespan \
                        that is greater than the 'span' timespan. \p\\

shortdesc = Performs statistics on indexed fields in tsidx files, which could come from normal index data, tscollect data, or accelerated datamodels.
description = Performs statistical queries on indexed fields in tsidx files. You can select from TSIDX data in several different ways:                                  \p\\
              1. Normal index data: If you do not supply a FROM clause, we will select from index data in the same way as search. You are restricted to selecting       \
                 from your allowed indexes by role, and you can control exactly which indexes you select from in the WHERE clause. If no indexes are mentioned          \
                 in the WHERE clause search, we will use your default set of indexes. By default, role-based search filters are applied, but can be turned off in limits.conf. \
                 ADVANCED: When the Splunk software indexes data, it segments each event into raw tokens using rules specified in segmenters.conf.    \
                           You may end up with raw tokens that are actually key-value pairs separated by an arbitrary delimiter such as a '='         \
                           symbol. The following search uses the 'walklex' command to find the raw tokens in your index, along with their count:      \
                           '| walklex index=<target-index> | where NOT like(term, "%::%") | stats sum(count) by term'                                 \
                           You can use the PREFIX directive in conjunction with 'tstats' to aggregate and group-by these values within the raw        \
                           tokens in your index. For example, say you have a set of raw tokens that feature a numeric value prefixed by 'kpbs=',      \
                           such as kbps=10 or kbps=333. If you run <tstats-func>(PREFIX(kbps)) on those tokens, the  processor returns '=10' and      \
                           '=333', which isn't exactly what you want, because many tstats aggregation functions require purely numeric values.        \
                           So you adjust your search to include the delimiter and run <tstats-func>(PREFIX(kbps=)) on those tokens. This returns      \
                           values of '10' and '333', which are perfect for tstats aggregation functions. \p\\
              2. Data manually collected with 'tscollect': Select from your namespace with 'FROM <namespace>'. If you supplied no namespace to tscollect, the data      \
                 was collected into the dispatch directory of that job. In that case, you would select from that data with 'FROM sid=<tscollect-job-id>'                \p\\
              3. An accelerated datamodel: Select from this accelerated datamodel with 'FROM datamodel=<datamodel-name>'                                                \
              You can provide any number of aggregates to perform, and also have the option of providing a filtering query using the WHERE keyword. This query looks    \
              like a normal query you would use in the search processor. You can also provide any number of GROUPBY fields. If you are grouping by _time, you should    \
              supply a timespan with 'span' for grouping the time buckets. This timespan looks like any normal timespan in Splunk, like '1hr' or '3d'. It also supports 'auto'.     \p\\
              Arguments:                                                                                                                                                \i\\
              "prestats": This simply outputs the answer in prestats format, in case you want to pipe the results to a                                                  \i\\
                          different type of processor that takes prestats output, like chart or timechart. This is very useful for                                      \i\\
                          creating graphs                                                                                                                               \i\\
              "local": If you set this to true it forces the processor to only be run on the search head.                                                               \i\\
              "append": Only valid in prestats mode, this allows tstats to be run to add results to an existing set of                                                  \i\\
                        results, instead of generating them.                                                                                                            \i\\
              "summariesonly": Only applies when selecting from an accelerated datamodel.  When false (default),                                                        \i\\
                               Splunk will generate results from both summarized data, as well as for data that is not                                                  \i\\
                               summarized. For data not summarized as TSIDX data, the full search behavior will be used                                                 \i\\
                               against the original index data.  If set to true, 'tstats' will only generate results from the                                           \i\\
                               TSIDX data that has been automatically generated by the acceleration, and nonsummarized data                                             \i\\
                               will not be provided.                                                                                                                    \i\\
              "include_reduced_buckets": Only applies when TSIDX reduction is enabled by setting enableTsidxReduction = true in indexes.conf.                           \i\\
                                         When include_reduced_buckets = false, Splunk generates results only from buckets that are not reduced                          \i\\
                                         The default for this setting is "false".                                                                                       \i\\
              "allow_old_summaries": Only applies when selecting from an accelerated datamodel.  When false                                                             \i\\
                                     (default), Splunk only provides results from summary directories when those directories are up-to-date.                            \i\\
                                     In other words, if the datamodel definition has changed, we do not use those summary directories                                   \i\\
                                     which are older than the new definition when producing output from tstats. This default ensures                                    \i\\
                                     that the output from tstats will always reflect your current configuration. If this is instead                                     \i\\
                                     set to true, then tstats will use both current summary data as well as summary data that was                                       \i\\
                                     generated prior to the definition change. Essentially this is an advanced performance                                              \i\\
                                     feature for cases where you know that the old summaries are "good enough".                                                         \i\\
              "use_summary_index_values": When this argument is set to 'false' (default), 'tstats' interprets events in summary index                                  \i\\
                                     buckets that contain prestats-prefixed fields as literal fields. When this argument is set to 'true',                             \i\\
                                     'tstats' treats those prestats-prefixed fields as partial aggregates (which is another way to refer                               \i\\
                                     to prestats data). The 'tstats' command interprets these partial aggregates in a manner similar to                                \i\\
                                     the way that the 'stats' command processes partial aggregates. The 'tstats' command then does a                                   \i\\
                                     fallback search for the buckets where the prestats fields are found, calling an equivalent 'stats'                                \i\\
                                     search only for those buckets. Enable this setting when you want 'tstats' to return the same results                              \i\\
                                     that an equivalent 'stats' search would return, such that it interprets values encoded as partial                                 \i\\
                                     aggregates. When 'use_summary_index_values=true', 'tstats' searches might perform slower, but their                               \i\\
                                     result sets will have parity with the result sets of corresponding 'stats' searches. When this                                    \i\\
                                     argument is set to 'false', 'tstats' simply looks at the 'tsidx' file and does not perform additional                             \i\\
                                     interpretation of partial aggregates.    \p\\

description = Creates one or more relative time fields and adds them to returned events. \

description = Useful for passing values up from a subsearch. Replaces the incoming events with one event, with one attribute: "search". Automatically limits the incoming results with "head" and "fields", to improve performance. Allows convenient outputting of attr=value (e.g., "return source"), alias_attr=value (e.g. "return ip=srcip"), and value (e.g., "return $srcip"). Defaults to using just the first row of results handed to it. Multiple rows can be specified with COUNT (e.g. "return 2 ip"), and each row is ORd (e.g., output might be "(ip=10.1.11.2) OR (ip=10.2.12.3)"). Multiple values can be specified and are placed within OR clauses. So "return 2 user ip" might output "(user=bob ip=10.1.11.2) OR (user=fred ip=10.2.12.3)". Using "return" at the end of a subsearch removes the need, in the vast majority of cases, for "head", "fields", "rename", "format", and "dedup".

[ingestpreview-command]
syntax = ingestpreview  (meta_mode=<string>)? (show_inputs=<bool>)? (ingest_processor=<string>)? (generate_helper_fields=<bool>)? ()
shortdesc = Helps preview ingest-time configuration settings without having to ingest or import data.
description = This search command takes incoming search results, \
                generates mock ingestion events from those results, \
                and supplies those mock events to the specified \
                ingestion processor, which then outputs the processed \
                events. This lets you quickly author ingest-time \
                configurations without having to upload or index \
                real data. For example, you can iterate or debug an \
                'INGEST_EVAL' or 'REGEX' transform, as well as troubleshoot \
                configurations in props.conf and transforms.conf. \p\\
              Arguments: \i\\
              "transforms:<key>=<value>" OR "props:<key>=<value>": Supply \
                        one or more settings for props /transforms using this \
                        syntax.  For example, to configure the REGEX setting \
                        in transforms.conf, specify transforms:REGEX=<your regex> \
                        NOTE: If field values contain spaces or special characters \
                        you can wrap the values in parenthesis or \
                        double quotes. The command strips the outer set of these \
                        characters before processing the arguments. \i\\
              "meta_mode": controls how the command displays the resulting _meta key.  The _meta \
                        key contains the map of indexed time field/value pairs. \
                        The command will always emit an '_meta' field if it is present in the results. \
                        However, Splunk Web will not show this by default since it is a field \
                        that starts with '_'.  Set this to: \
                        "unhide" - Creates an alias to the _meta field named "META" \
                                   so its visible in Splunk Web.  Equivalent to '|eval META=_meta' \
                        "expand" - if you want to have each indexed time field/value pair become \
                                   a separate field.  Each field will be prefixed with "META." \
                        "all" - performs both EXPAND and UNHIDE behavior \
                        "none" - performs neither EXPAND or UNHIDE behavior \
                        Defaults to "unhide". \i\\
              "show_inputs": If set to true, the command generates INPUT.* fields for each input field with the original \
                        value before transformation.  This is helpful to compute the difference between input and output \
                        for a particular field \
                        Defaults to "false". \i\\
              "ingest_processor": The target ingest-time processor, \
                        accepts one of the following values: \
                        'regexreplacement', 'metrics', 'metricschema'. \
                        Use 'metrics' for statsd/collectd data. \
                        Use 'metricschema' for logs to metrics. \
                        Defaults to 'regexreplacement'.  \i\\
              "generate_helper_fields": emits three extra fields: 'TRANSFORMS.CONF', 'PROPS.CONF' \
                        and 'WARNS.ERRS' \
                        'TRANSFORMS.CONF' and 'PROPS.CONF' fields will generate the exact \
                        settings you can copy and paste into props/transforms.conf. \
                        These settings might differ from the settings you supply \
                        to this search command becasue of various character \
                        escaping rule discrepancies between the search language \
                        and configuration files. Command due to various escaping \
                        rule discrepencies between the search language and \
                        configuration files. \
                        The 'WARNS.ERRS' will display any errors or warnings reported \
                        by processor that will help further troubleshoot settings \
                        Defaults to true. \i\\

[prjob-command]
syntax = prjob [<subsearch>]
shortdesc = Enables use of parallel reduce search processing to speed up search \
            runtime of a set of supported SPL commands, in a distributed search \
            environment.
description = The prjob command tells Splunk to run a search using parallel \
              reduce search processing if possible. This is particularly useful to \
              speed up high-cardinality searches that aggregate large numbers of \
              search results. \p\\
              The prjob command provides the same functionality as the \
              redistribute command. However, it has a simpler syntax and is \
              easier to use. It uses the default values for the redistribute \
              command arguments. Use the prjob command when you want to run a \
              simple parallel reduce job without managing the by-clause field and \
              the number of intermediate reducers. \p\\
              The prjob command requires a distributed search environment with a \
              pool of intermediate reducers at the indexer level. \p\\
              The prjob command must be the first command in a search. It supports \
              streaming commands and the following nonstreaming commands: stats, tstats \
              streamstats, eventstats, sistats, sichart, and sitimechart. \
              The prjob command also supports transaction on a single field. \p\\
example1 = "| prjob [ | ... | stats count by ip]"
comment1 = Speeds up a stats search that aggregates a large number of results. \
           The "| stats count by ip" portion of the search is processed on the \
           intermediate reducers. The search head just aggregates the results.
example2 = "| prjob [ | ... | eventstats count by user, source | where  count>10 | sitimechart max(count) by source | timechart max(count) by source]"
comment2 = Speeds up a search that includes eventstats and which uses \
           sitimechart to perform the statistical calculations for a timechart \
           operation. The intermediate reducers process eventstats, where, and \
           sitimechart. The search head runs timechart to turn the reduced \
           sitimechart statistics into sorted, visualization-ready results. \
example3 = "| prjob [ | tstats prestats=t count by _time span=1d | sitimechart span=1d count | timechart span=1d count]"
comment3 = Speeds up a search that uses tstats to generate events. The \
           tstats command must be placed at the start of the subsearch, \
           and here it uses prestats=t to work with the timechart command. \
           sitimechart is processed on the reducers and timechart is processed on \
           the search head.
example4 = "| prjob [ | ... | eventstats count by user, source | where count >10  | sort 0 -num(count) | ...]"
comment4 = In this example, the eventstats and where commands are processed \
          in parallel on the reducers, while the sort command and any commands \
          following it are processed on the search head. This happens because \
          sort is a nonstreaming command that is not supported by prjob.
