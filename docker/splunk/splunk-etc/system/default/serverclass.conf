#   Version 9.0.3
# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE!
# Changes to default files will be lost on update and are difficult to
# manage and support.
#
# Please make any changes to system defaults by overriding them in
# apps or $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local  
# (See "Configuration file precedence" in the web documentation).
#
# To override a specific setting, copy the name of the stanza and
# setting to the file where you wish to override it.
#
# This file defines server classes to which deployment clients can belong, for
# the purposes of distributing Splunk configuration data.  The per-class
# attributes and values specify what content a given server class member will
# receive from the deployment server.
#
# To learn more about configuration files (including precedence) please see the documentation 
# located at http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Aboutconfigurationfiles
